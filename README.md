This repository contains the data and materials for the second coursework of INFR11157 (2020-21).

To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomsherborne/nlu_cw2
```
The first thing you should do is set up a working Conda environment for your work. The `requirements.txt` file has been updated here. So run `conda create` if you want to create a brand new NLU environment OR run `conda install --file requirements.txt` to update your existing environment.

```bash
conda create -n nlu --file ./requirements.txt -c pytorch
```
Then, continue following the instructions in the instruction sheet available on Blackboard Learn.

##### Acnowledgements
This code is based on [Binh Tang's NMT Tutorial](https://github.com/tangbinh/machine-translation) and the data is a sample
of [Europarl](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/).
