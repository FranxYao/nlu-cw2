the european union has an increasingly important influence in this process .
mr president , i am the reprehensible author , or co - author of the resolution .
two weeks later , we can be cautiously optimistic .
as i see it , controlling the enforcers should be a job for the commission .
what is at stake here ?
that is an exceptionally positive thing .
two hundred and sixty - six people arrived in a single boat .
it is not there yet .
. mr president , i would like to say a few words on our reasons for raising this oral question .
mr president , in a democracy , transparency is a concept of honour .
let us oppose this latest example of red tape from the top .
many thanks , mr   president .
mr korakas has the floor .
we must protect the whole of the enlarged europe from any risk of impoverishment of any part of it .
( ro ) madam president , competitiveness is not an option for the european union .
. i want to commend mr   putin .
why did i vote against it ?
the autonomous communities are also states .
it will present its conclusions before the end of this year .
thank you , mr dimitrakopoulos .
we will amend this .
president - in - office of the council . - ( cs ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for a very useful debate .
mr president , greetings to commissioner füle .
over and over again , the charge is ' separatist propaganda ' .
what is the situation with the new parliament building with regard to asbestos ?
that is when all is said and done a great disincentive .
accordingly , i can not accept the critical stance of the lamassoure report .
the prosecution of mr pamuk raises serious concerns in this respect .
a great deal has been done , including in terms of the measures to be taken .
( parliament approved the request )
madam president , daphne is the young woman in greek mythology who was chased by the god apollo .
so we have a crunch here about setting firm targets .
i am sorry that it has not thought about public opinion .
we deplore the line that mr hernandez mollar and his colleague have put forward .
in this regard , i share some of the reservations expressed by mrs peijs .
we know this from china .
mr president , minister , ladies and gentlemen , i do not have a great deal to add to what mrs durant has just said .
i would like to thank the rapporteur .
i am responding to this on my own behalf and that of my colleague , commissioner verheugen .
in order to treat certain illnesses better we have to address the causes .
declaration of financial interests : see minutes
how can we now pull things together again ?
what about the other twelve member states ?
we are decidedly against adhering to the old system .
i think that should suffice .
but that is not for next year .
on 18 april 2007 , we obtained our first interim order in relation to an infrastructural project .
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate ruth hieronymi on her excellent work on this issue .
embalming is now common , technology has moved on .
we look for a change of scenery , sunshine in winter , and for that you have to go a long way .
they said they were suffering discrimination , because they were not included in the accession process .
we can look at those in the future .
we expect the first troops to arrive in the region before the weekend .
refugee status in member states ( continuation )
we expect something far more concrete from the pdb .
an impartial system of certification will be , we suppose , appreciated also by consumers .
thirdly , mr beazley raised the question of double standards .
the commission will also present a report which will be made public .
there were too many irregularities and the administrative culture it represented was a spurious one .
when there are no fish , there is no catch .
thank you , mr karlsson .
at the moment they can not do that and so they are , as you say , at risk .
the commission will keep you duly informed about the process , as requested .
so why is it that this reform is so problematic ?
i would like to hear more about respecting your own regulations .
it is clear that we condemn religious integrist terrorism .
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas .
it is now up to the council to find an answer to the commission 's proposals .
this danger does not concern austria , it concerns europe .
its economy is booming but it is a pity about the poor .
it will become a lot clearer in one or two years ' time .
the european union must guard against it .
that is , of course , cheaper and helps bring down the defence budget .
madam president , i should like to congratulate mr spencer on his excellent work .
the good news is that there will not be many more of these procedures .
now we shall have something to work on with the commission at community level .
in addition , we all know that a part of the appropriations still remains unspent .
in large part i can say ' yes ' , but not entirely .
but what we have here is a severe procedural problem .
the summit must be for debate and must not concentrate on that sole or principal topic .
around 15 % of citizens in the european union live below the poverty threshold .
it is not only indonesia , it is all of us that may be the victims of what is happening .
of course , protecting the planet means much more than just cleaning up the atmosphere .
in the meantime , i have raised two parliamentary questions on this issue .
shame on us europeans ! we were able to supply berlin when the people there were under siege !
finally , the president - in - office of the council has also referred to the financial outlook .
it can be done another way .
there is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen .
thank you , commissioner .
on that occasion words of appreciation and praise were spoken .
what are the concrete threats and how do we give an appropriate response ?
i should like to make a number of comments .
the country must fight corruption actively .
but we all know what that is already .
madam president , on a point of order . i refer to rule 53(5 ) .
you will appreciate that culture necessarily entails opening up .
unfortunately , the european union began by missing an historic opportunity .
we can not allow this situation to exist : we must do everything in our power to prevent it .
meanwhile , the common position against cuba is being maintained .
however , i would like to hear you whistle .
enlargement will perhaps have been completed by this time , and we may even have a constitution .
i should just like to take up a few points which seem to me important .
flexibility and security of employment are not opposites but , instead , preconditions of each other .
as in each of the past few years , i have voted against granting the commission discharge for 2001 .
that means that the euro is at present the only project for strengthening the union .
then there is the matter of the court rulings .
( ga ) those are the most important points in my opinion .
the parliamentary elections on 28 november will be a big test for moldova .
we can not get around this point .
we need to work on this .
we have a clear part to play .
in this area , everything is done with a total lack of transparency .
as a result , its credibility was reinforced , as was its position at international level .
the socialists are therefore afraid of adopting a position before the european elections .
that is very important .
i think you have seen that we have been very open .
so to be consistent with that position , we are going to support referral back to committee .
we are still vulnerable , and we still have a problem with waste .
but i say to them , the proverb may apply to broth but not to our coasts .
thank you very much , commissioner .
however there is still much to be done to ensure that there is flexibility .
the debate is closed .
this reflects credit on the work we did there .
it is essential that the decision should now be taken in march .
all politicians should analyse what a war with iraq would lead to .
the only way to combat doping is through zero tolerance .
such protests have been serious , in the last instance resulting in a death .
now to the proposed amendments .
but the eu must not introduce bans and detailed regulations .
3 . sudan : killing of african union peace - keeping soldiers
at the same time , we know that demographic developments will only intensify the problem .
abuses of this kind must be stopped and the law must be enforced .
let us not terrorise the individual .
let us be clear that this is of tremendous importance to all the people of europe .
that is what it is really about , ladies and gentlemen .
in writing . - there is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory .
i would be interested to hear what view the commission takes of these product bans .
it sticks .
such models are very costly and hard to control .
so should i sit around doing nothing , just waiting for something to turn up ?
moreover , the european commission has expressed itself along the same lines as parliament .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
the socialists have let two out of ten years simply pass by .
3 . justice for the " comfort women "
that is unacceptable .
this is not the open europe or the transparent europe that i want .
it is both desirable and necessary that europe should play an independent security policy role .
more than this , it is a known fact and recognition of this fact .
that is why it surely makes good sense to decide now .
for millions of our citizens , it became a necessity .
efforts to adapt to climate change must be made as soon as possible .
we certainly hope that a resolution of this situation will be forthcoming .
this necessity has also been mentioned in the draft conclusions .
that is the path that commissioner mccreevy has mapped out , and we ask you , tomorrow , to close it off .
but let us discuss that openly .
now for your proposed amendments to the chapter on controls .
the way in which you extracted yourself from that tight corner leaves much to be desired .
the commission is the guardian of the treaties .
mr president , i am totally in agreement with mrs wallis ’s conclusion .
we must make better use of our tools and provide more and better training .
the stabilising effect of the nordic dimension can not be underestimated .
the eu is not a union of unstable developing countries .
but we have to ask ourselves how matters ever got to this state .
( the sitting was suspended for a few moments )
the finnish presidency wants to promote the new tampere spirit .
there are no secrets in this particular proposal .
in these countries , too , the situation is very alarming .
we can not allow ourselves to perceive every refugee as a potential terrorist .
( de ) mr president , i wish to drop a few more flies into the ointment .
so how could i not vote for this report ?
according to the united nations , 1.2 million are children .
the entire leadership of the hep party in prison and on trial last thursday .
if we no longer export to these destinations , others will do it in our place .
the vote will take place at 11.00 .
that would be unacceptable and unwise .
allow me to congratulate my colleague , mrs petre , for this excellent report .
the reason for this can be found in people ’s mindsets and a lack of education .
yes , that has been decided .
it has been a truly excellent chairmanship .
i thought this would cost thousands .
we also have to insist on democracy in those countries that are supposed to be our allies .
the treaty of lisbon has introduced far - reaching changes to the area of common trade policy .
the solvit centres have received a lot of praise , and i fully support this .
in theory , we are discussing own resources . in practice , we are discussing national contributions .
in the opinion of the presidency , the negotiations were successful .
this is a lost opportunity .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
that is something that needs to be addressed in the reform .
documents received : see minutes
the report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction .
to quote our national anthem , we are ' a land of mountains , a land of valleys ' .
to my mind , this concept is not conveyed clearly enough in the goerens report .
so it is appropriate that we look at the work of this observatory in lisbon at this stage .
in order to achieve their ends , these holy warriors resort unscrupulously to violence .
that is why i believe that we must take a very cautious approach to the net contributor debate .
firstly , the coordinator 's independence remains untouched .
i wish the commission success in its efforts to this end .
apart from that , the resolution includes several positive aspects , such as :
the new version is an improvement on the last one .
montenegro , however , is not alone in facing these problems .
i heard mr erbakan speak very forcibly against the customs union .
this will result in the disappearance of whole species .
you said that the response needs to be a regional one .
how will they travel and how will they prove that they belong to a member state ?
if you believe that this matter is urgent , you should ask for it to be included in a forthcoming debate .
that is the very reason why this issue was considered in the wto .
we have to come forward with proper methods of conservation and proper methods of supervision .
i wish the parliament had supported mr waigel more .
thank you , commissioner .
we had this problem with an acp meeting , which broke up as a result .
and the primary market means of protecting knowledge is the patent .
under the guatemalan penal code , trafficking in children is not a crime and does not carry a penalty .
what is possible , though , is a tax on co2 .
association agreements are an excellent way to put pressure on countries .
at this stage i would not disagree with her .
since the author is not present , question no 33 lapses .
when i look at the infrastructure of the sncb , the neglect is striking .
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
it must be possible for both men and women who are the parents of young children to take part in training .
to each his role , to each his responsibility .
also , we should not mix up status quo with stability .
well , what price free speech , what price democracy ?
the posting of this information on websites must be transparent and independent .
how can we also stabilise raw material prices in the long term ?
this is where immediate action is required .
they could be at risk .
its aim will not be to constrain local authorities , but rather to help them .
i am afraid that at the moment the jury is out .
technical and organisational issues are very important in relation to airport capacity .
all of this creates pointless bureaucracy that frightens industry away .
the trafficking of women is linked to illegal immigration .
furthermore , we must not get things confused .
today 's final draft of the directive contains three important achievements .
parliament should take its monitoring task seriously .
what is going to deliver is building more of the european union within ukraine .
the report recognises that the solvit project is up and running .
where are we , a year and a half after this demand was worded ?
i would , for example , remind you of the difficulties the christians are facing in that country .
that is the reason for the interpretative communication .
how many prospective meps will be standing on this ticket ?
if there are any , what might they be ?
only china has benefited from it .
in writing . - ( pt ) this proposal is part of a package of measures within the road transport sector .
( the sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m. )
i am proud of them .
but i say that the elderly are worth more .
in this sort of situation , there are no free or easy solutions .
( for results and other details of the vote : see minutes )
amendments nos 4 , 54 , 57 and 68 are superfluous to this proposal .
when it talks about fighting by bulls , it is clearly talking about bullfights .
i do not want to imply that these are groups that are subject to targeted and conscious discrimination .
mr president , 25 march is the birthday of both europe and greece .
we need that as well if we are to reduce our dependence .
request for the waiver of johannes voggenhuber 's immunity
that would solve all the problems associated with this initiative .
i have a question in connection with relations with russia .
our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
i think this agreement is ambitious as well as realistic .
otherwise , we can not deliver more !
this will be the golden era for international crime .
who is the target ?
with your permission , i will illustrate this by way of a few examples .
i would like to say a couple of words on financial instruments .
at present , there is virtually no treatment for the disease and no cure either .
i am particularly grateful to them for dealing with the matter with such great speed .
they do not at all give the true story of egg production in the european union .
the european parliament should also play a key role here .
mr president , firstly , i too wish to say thank you to mrs wallström .
freedom of association must therefore always be respected .
consumers would gradually turn their attention more to processed foods .
it is not right that only certain people receive equal treatment and that others do not .
we need a combination of law and individual effort .
however , font size is only one of many factors in this .
the european union should seek and apply the total and unconditional cancellation of the debt .
we are now on the home straight , having come to the recommendation for second reading .
i also wish to make it clear , however , that we will not remain neutral in the event of a conflict .
i share his view .
this is the first injustice .
elsewhere , it bemoans the fact that europe has an ageing population .
women now occupy the majority of part - time jobs : 83 % .
indeed , those in doubt overlook the many achievements that our countries have now made .
with the consent of these countries , it will also be possible to carry out on - the - spot inspections .
i know that it is not the european year of sport that you had wanted .
you spoke , commissioner , of the digital divide .
i think the rapporteur 's approach is reasonable .
the union must behave honourably here .
so we have a double problem there .
you have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner .
terrorism today is a problem that not only affects europe .
it has already had the worst of the fight .
an antisocial market economy has no place in the profile of a european union .
surely this is unwise , as has been mentioned by many colleagues already .
we must make sure that these two things are not confused .
greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in 1998 but now it does .
what kind of democracy is it that fails to guarantee water for all ?
chee soon juan is not a criminal .
it should not be about private versus state .
because of all these issues , we shall not vote in favour of this budget .
if you do not have a dialogue , then it is harder , if not impossible , to communicate your view .
there is no point in trying to pacify wild animals by playing music .
the buses are only part of it .
of course compromises have had to be made .
can we reasonably speak of illegal expropriation ?
the key criterion here must be added value for europe .
transfers of appropriations : see minutes
i must say that that is not the case .
at present , there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects .
it is fine by us ; that is life on the democratic stage .
that was made clear on your side .
the requirement to export milk products from the eu is growing .
subject : eu peacekeeping mission to chad
we must be able to trust them .
however , if we now make that 40 signatures , then the reform no longer makes sense .
at its best the knowledge society can be a social dimension of the new capitalism .
education is going to be increasingly important .
we have abstained from voting because the aims of the report are unclear .
of these , 12 % were applications from people who had already sought asylum .
this is the area where impressive savings can be realised with relatively small outlay .
nothing , absolutely nothing .
member of the commission . - mr president , i am representing the high commissioner and i am representing the commission .
i also see this to some extent as an endorsement of my own work .
almost 17 % of european women are ranked as living in poverty .
this ought to happen through unanimous decisions and not by majority decision .
these efforts have been paying off .
achieving peace in the middle east is one of the most important and urgent tasks in front of us .
for my part , i voted in favour of mrs ross ' nomination .
this is exactly what mrs garcía arias wants .
it is on loan to us from future generations .
let us do something about this !
they are very static in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .
the outcome of this will be even more immigration and all the problems which that leads to .
finally , i wish to thank the rapporteur , who has done some excellent work .
moral values also have an important role to play .
so do not wait too long !
the report assumes an overly one - sided political view of human rights in the union .
in international transport , too , the same rules should apply .
the debate is closed .
it shows courage when you consider how certain farmers have been known to react .
( parliament rejected the oral amendment )
to return to the eur   40   million , it can only be the beginning .
such research is an essential building block for innovation and competitiveness .
the eu must therefore speak with one voice , and a strong one at that .
the debate is closed .
as a consequence , the internal measures that need to be taken must be adapted to the specific situations in the respective countries .
it is for that reason that clear rules are needed .
it is a treaty language and it should have that status .
the problems facing melilla and ceuta are not just spain ’s problem : they are europe ’s problem .
we voted against this report .
are you thinking about giving olympic airways a chance , commissioner ?
the justices ruled by a narrow margin of five votes to four .
the choice ought to be simple .
but as this new crisis shows , it is not enough merely to remove the refuse from the streets .
we must not forget this .
the total amount of funding provided by the efg amounts to eur 453 750 .
then we need to ask : where do we start ?
no , we do not .
– yes to a more active role for the eu within the un , as recommended by the report .
we are therefore moving , at least in part , in the direction you desire .
without any real savings , the efforts of the council are reduced to cuts in estimates .
in fact , it is precisely this european parliament issue that i would like to comment on .
i just wish to make two additional points .
mr mulder stated we are on the right track , but wondered how long this would last .
you are an asset to your country .
what difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "
this commission document covers a whole range of issues .
we have done so because we want european development to move in a characteristically social democratic direction .
allow me to say that i listened with the greatest interest to mr   lauk ’s report and to mr   maaten ’s report .
the exact rate is 49 % .
that balance has , i think , been found in this report .
this will reflect the central priority i attach to research and innovation .
we need more coordination between the nordic council , the barents euro - arctic council , and the baltic sea council .
this is also reflected in the opinion of the council legal service .
the same things can be said about the romanian communities in bulgaria and ukraine .
- before the vote :
as a consequence of this the number of flights is visibly increasing in a dramatic way .
that is the one thing that we have learned recently .
foreign lorries now control 80 % of cross - channel business .
it is therefore very important that we send those countries a message .
food supplements are not medicinal products , nor can they serve as substitutes for medicinal products .
let the possession of pornographic material intended for children be criminalized .
the report was adopted by 467 votes in favour , with 11 votes against and 9 abstentions .
this kind of action can not entertain any ambiguity .
that is why it is a good thing that a transitional period is clearly defined in this directive .
i also want to raise another point of order .
it is just empty talk .
that is why the british labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report .
no doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on wednesday .
– mr president , i think that there is ambiguity here . we do not understand .
what will then be important is that the concept , the vision , that underlies the concept of a european capital of culture should play more of a role .
what is happening in south korea today should be seen as a grave warning .
there has been no other country about which we have accepted so many resolutions with so little effect .
but there is , indeed , ' no room for complacency ' in europe .
this therefore requires political awareness and , for me , that has two goals .
you gave a good coverage of all the issues that we are facing .
( es ) mr president , we , too , wish to refer to rule 177 of the rules of procedure .
especially now that the european union is becoming increasingly involved in european inland navigation policy , consultation with the sector is vital with regard to this directive but also in other areas .
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan ?
the italian parliament has just proven that it is independent .
the conclusion i draw from this experience is that europe can benefit enormously from this process in ukraine .
in so doing , the council itself will need to develop and apply new and effective working methods .
turkey 's conduct is provocative .
the score so far is 10 countries in favour and two against .
mrs scheele wished that there had also been coordination with the candidate countries .
ireland is holding a referendum on the amsterdam treaty .
that is not contained in the articles at all , only in the annex .
those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to acquire knowledge either .
we now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time .
you can not have one without the other .
in this picture , where is europe ?
regional policy is one of the spearheads of european integration .
witness its brutal invasion and occupation of northern cyprus .
that is precisely where i am protecting the farmers , as your colleagues have just said .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon .
the charter was only a political declaration when it was initially agreed in 2000 .
torture is still widely practised .
( noise , heckling )
mr president , in the occupied part of cyprus political crimes are rampant and on the increase .
white paper on sport ( debate )
obviously , we will not deviate from our fundamental principles .
these means include , for example , the establishment of an eu economic government .
the palestinians are prepared to compromise . they are not demanding west jerusalem .
that is why i paid particular attention to what has been said here .
question no 54 by ari vatanen ( h-0470/03 ) :
israel must fulfil its obligations to the united nations security council .
i have nothing against russian investment in montenegro or any other country .
it is more that the policy of the euro countries has contributed far too little to economic convergence .
instead , we should ensure that we have only one seat .
capital punishment ( virginia , yemen )
we are therefore aiming to promote democracy and respect for human rights .
this principle is important in a constitutional state .
i wonder if the commissioner agrees with me on this ?
it must also encourage change in countries where there is no effective democracy .
the report recognizes the amount of money spent on research .
we had requested a report on sickness absence for this year .
however , complaints must be handled through the appropriate legal channels .
thank you very much , mrs lulling .
in addition to this , the final report failed to acknowledge the amount of money being wasted on strasbourg .
a television without frontiers .
in any case , why is she not here ?
i welcome the amendments in the report by parliament ’s committee on fisheries .
where is your leader ’s approach ?
this gives me , as rapporteur , real satisfaction .
to conclude , i therefore ask you to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow mep , mr   weber .
that is not within parliament ' s competence .
the netherlands , as far as this is concerned , is no exception .
we need that now .
to be frank , some multinational corporations are still tempted to follow this practice today .
in my own country , we are now talking in terms of more than eur 100 million .
further enlargement can not be achieved without additional funds for the union .
i am sure that mr seal and his colleagues have noted this position .
i would therefore ask the house to approve it .
the macroeconomic indicators and nature of the political debate prove this .
but we must have one in future .
we all know that their causes are , in the long run , partly linked .
it is therefore unclear why the rapporteur ultimately ruled out this .
thank you for your attention .
i said earlier that it is not possible to give the floor to others .
the work has been unanimously adopted in committee and i value that highly .
obviously it is a debate that touches a lot of people 's concerns in the house .
resumption of the session
i very much hope that more members of the epp / ed group will support this report .
this is a legal point .
governments , public institutions and the commission should lead the way by example .
madam president , i congratulate the rapporteur and all who have helped him in this work .
that is , in fact , much more important than individual detailed formulations in the written guidelines .
and we can say to you : yes , it is a priority to continue this approach .
that means incitement and not just fraud .
written statements ( rule 149 )
in my country nicotine replacement therapy is only available by medical prescription .
these directives make these quite explicit .
the third point relates to homosexual practices between men .
the president - in - office of the council , the greek minister for foreign affairs mr papandreou , has the floor .
my group feels that some of the proposals made by the rapporteur go into too much detail .
since 1999 , other countries across europe have rediscovered democracy .
the sector is impatiently awaiting revision of the ucits directive .
this is also one of the reasons why we have given this proposal such clear support .
the commission has published four of these communications so far .
it is vital that we maintain these sectors for a number of reasons .
this decision will enter into force on 1 may 2001 .
i would therefore ask you to clarify once more what you understand by ‘ information programmes’ .
champagne and cognac are strictly defined .
when the time for a review comes , we hope that there will be some further tightening up .
that is why - in spite of what the clock said - i did not use the gavel to stop you .
commercial policy can harmonise closely with development policy .
so i would have liked today , to see both the commission , and also the council , fully represented .
if we can do things better , i am here to cooperate .
we are looking forward to the talks on asem iv .
the next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions :
rather than stigmatise these people , we need to put an end to these human tragedies .
2004 has not been belarus 's best year .
thirdly , i will mention agriculture .
this move will be institutionalising inefficiency and there is no justification for it .
i hope that we will succeed in doing so in future , too .
that is why the citizens of the european union are rightly calling for a more effective approach .
i offer all my thanks for the support given by the rapporteur , mr pirilli .
we need clarification on that before we continue the talks on pnr .
the entire common agricultural policy is an absurd contrivance and must be abolished .
clarity always remains condition no 1 .
( ro ) 2010 is the european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
this is a joke ; nobody can live on it .
