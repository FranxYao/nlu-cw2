public opinion is caught up in strictly national debates .
it is not a story from the last century .
and that is the essence of my report as well .
madam president , i also wish to express my best wishes to the dutch presidency .
bear in mind that we do not all use the same system .
mr de rossa said that the national carrier is as sacred as the national anthem .
we now have the si - ii system for sections managing funds .
however , i have to ask whether we are all equal .
but there is an alternative afghanistan .
this would hit the regime hard , because oil exports account for 90 % of its income .
i want an answer to my question .
the last leaves much to be desired in the baltic .
this jti has been welcomed by parliament :
key words are thus advice , methodology , procedures , guidelines , training , etc .
it will make it much more friendly and more interactive if you all come to the front .
we have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important .
i think we have to continue to do so .
the prerequisite for all prosperity remains , as it always has been , healthy economic growth .
plans are tied at the present time to calendar years within the electoral term .
our policy towards china is one of constructive engagement .
directly acceptable : amendment 120 ( text as a whole , block no 1 , compromise amendment ) .
that is something to which we object , in spite of a number of good intentions in the proposed resolution .
i will be , mr wynn .
there are many causes of this .
it was a compromise .
thank you , mr monti .
this is a priority cross - cutting objective of the belgian presidency .
it is not very appropriate to impose separate restrictions on refinery fuels .
in conclusion , i believe that the draft mandate is a true substantial improvement .
what is worst is when degenerates of this kind are also defended with the aid of the law .
these areas present the big challenge for the barcelona process in the future .
well - intentioned colleagues have fallen naively into this anti - european trap .
it is with good reason that we identify nationality with the flag , the police and the judge .
fishery management needs frameworks that are tailor - made for it and that will last for years .
allow me to make three proposals : .....
the zeal of the convert , no doubt .
the position of women has hardly improved in most countries .
according to this plan in nairobi we had certain priorities which were achieved .
, madam president , i wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a fine report .
the castellina report is rightly both positive and critical .
i am curious to see who will vote for culling tomorrow .
the essential complement ...
the commissioner should on no account permit such mushrooming of what is recognised as an airport system .
there is no doubt that the palestinian population urgently needs aid .
that is the approach our work has been taking .
the employment situation in europe seems to be slightly improving .
why were the united states so insistent ?
mr elles also raised the issue of the number of commissioners .
let me thank , in particular , the rapporteur , mr el khadraoui .
however , i do endorse some of the arguments .
we have had sanctions in the form of a visa ban against the belarus leaders in the past .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
i am at a loss to understand how such transcripts of a criminal nature can be published .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mr lehne for his report .
it applies to your country , my country and many others .
but the door remains open .
the next item is the commission statement on the effects of storm xynthia in europe .
mr president , allow me to ask you just one question concerning the mccarthy report .
the primary aim of agriculture has always been to produce food .
we can not ask more from new member states than from the current member states .
decentralised power supplies are in the hands of the people .
this is wrong , simply wrong !
could you please tell us if the commission will be making an announcement soon ?
this amendment makes very good sense .
these clauses must be examined just as closely as economic ones .
of course , people here have various reservations .
the us and china together account for almost half .
tomorrow , parliament will not be able to do that .
we have been silent for too long about these issues .
it replaces the whole of paragraph 8 , not just the second paragraph .
support the independent media , and help the opposition to make its voice heard !
the volcano eruption laid a cloud of volcanic ash over most of europe .
mr kuhne mentioned the european security strategy .
i only found one person who tried to vote twice , an old woman of about 80 .
this would be equivalent to financing the war effort of that specific faction .
forty - four per cent of this amount has been spent by the united states on military and police operations , for example .
the commission has demonstrated its concern about this matter in the report .
this is my first point .
however , perhaps we do not need to impose regulations covering every detail .
we realise the significant difficulties which the commission faces daily .
let us set our course for that objective .
the reforms for which we have striven have now been set in motion ; they must not be put off to another day .
the first has to do with reporting back to us .
we realise that there are now delays in achieving the expected targets .
there was hardly any discussion and parliament and the council agreed .
in short , one disadvantage engenders another .
proper use requires coordination and participation at all levels .
i would like finally to mention the area of continuing education .
i understand that the assassination was ordered by the regime in burma .
by way of conclusion , i should like to add a brief observation on the protection of intellectual property .
the legal basis now in force makes this impossible .
and we still got on with each other , as mrs roth - behrendt emphasized this morning .
that is , in fact , the objective of this paper .
the council wanted industry involved in galileo as early as possible .
i hope that was a misunderstanding and that she did not mean to insinuate that .
in fact , the real debate should not be about that at all .
therefore , i am calling on everyone involved to comply with this request from the commission .
i have no alternative in the circumstances we find ourselves in tonight .
i am grateful for the response to this question .
it is the issue of federalism .
mr president , my answer is as follows .
it is an excellent symbol of the transformation of the european union .
that is an obstacle to development and prosperity .
mr president , banks were once revered in ireland .
this means that particular importance should be attached to the closing comment of the el khadraoui report .
i hope we shall manage to ensure that it is .
i thank him warmly for his much - appreciated work .
are romanian women fundamentally different to women in other countries ?
so i really can not say whether this would be an answer to the problem .
european council in florence - igc
maybe mr   cohn - bendit ought to consider to whom he actually wishes to give his support .
europe is pan - european .
if i rephrase it like this , then my reply is ' yes ' .
one of them is the question of the rome statute .
we want clarification on that .
i do not think much of that .
guidelines for the trans - european transport network
but wait for what ?
this is why i call on mr kerr to think back to the day of the vote .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for a very comprehensive answer .
as a whole , i regard this picture as a favourable one .
that is why amendment no 10 is so important .
their concern , however , is that inflation will reach 5 % this year .
it needs to be applied .
this means that elections must take place as for the committees .
nevertheless , i have tabled an amendment .
i was not referring to any other problem .
thank you , commissioner .
they are continuing to repeat the old patterns .
these weapons are also largely responsible for the phenomenon of child soldiers .
the second challenge that we must face is directly related to what i have just said .
tomorrow i understand there will be a new children 's law .
you can put it down to the fact that this is the first time i have acted as vice - president .
where the media are concerned , however , the issue has been dealt with in a most unsatisfactory manner .
what we see happening , in fact , is something that is spreading to a dangerous extent these days .
the european union has very clearly held out the prospect of a mediterranean partnership to libya .
and these negotiations are shrouded in complete secrecy .
the ninth round of dialogue took place last november .
we are extremely committed to maintaining solidarity with aung san suu kyi .
( de ) i should like to reiterate once more that we are currently at a very important stage of the status process .
this involves the appointment of senior officers , something to which you referred , commissioner .
waiting for the committee to complete its findings will take too long .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
it contributes to a living and long - lasting democracy .
in fact , the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms .
how will we approach security threats and terrorism ?
the deterrent effect ought to be comparable throughout the entire union .
that is why i particularly emphasise the importance of this programme .
i should just like to examine the amendments .
it is up to the member states to decide such issues .
problems will remain , and new ones will arise .
regardless of the opposing paths that inevitably occur , our relations are constructive and future - oriented .
the enemy is the people .
we will have three quarters of an hour because it will be followed by a statement by president santer .
internet penetration has increased .
council position at first reading : see minutes
i am now proud of the german government .
for all that lisbon matters , it will not define this european election campaign .
our philosophy is the complete opposite .
the problems and advantages need to be weighed up with a critical eye .
mr president , first i would like to thank mr ferber for an excellent report .
furthermore , it is not practical to test all animals for all known diseases .
this report is indeed remarkable in many aspects .
how can it be negotiated ?
it was not indicated which agencies would be affected .
i would like to assure mr mitchell of the commission 's utmost respect for parliament .
papua has equally been a matter of continued concern and the subject of eu démarches .
they think it an anachronism .
the spirit that prevails in the conference of presidents may differ from that of the plenary .
i will gladly let you see the text approved by the austrian parliament .
we share a common history and social values with them .
i do not want to make this political because for me this is not political .
the cause , of course , is poverty , criminality and a breakdown in civil society .
this debate will continue .
we have made tremendous progress in the last three years .
mr gallagher has offered a ray of hope .
subject : chemical and electro - shock technology
we need workable solutions to this .
could you confirm whether this has already been done or is at least in hand ?
the organization of common activities of both institutions requires special attention .
we should now adopt these proposals by a clear majority in the interests of our closest confidants .
i admit that , with you sitting there , i find it more difficult .
the debate is closed .
today , i should like to look at much more recent history .
i would not want to see any citizens treated in the same way as these students .
europe can not remain silent and do nothing .
i would like to hear what the commissioner thinks about this .
like many others , i am opposed to advertisements aimed at children .
approximately 60 % of all financial aid comes out of the european pot .
vital , says the g8 .
in this respect , achieving the barcelona goals is especially important .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
i look forward to a more intimate relationship with china in the years ahead .
clear messages have to be sent out .
another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money .
the supreme constitutional court is about to be dissolved .
it allows us to defend true principles and to act on them .
wild salmon forms only 5 - 10 % of all the salmon in the baltic sea .
i want to make this point even clearer .
however , the report also contains requirements for minimum wage systems .
there is , therefore , the risk that the governments are going to put a spanner in the works .
for this reason , the proposal provides for a standard level in the veterinary sector .
they have also a special human rights adviser , another lady who is also working particularly on this issue .
it is , however , as everyone knows , quite late in the day to be talking about this , here and now .
floods are natural disasters and , as such , can not be completely prevented .
we should not forego the opportunity to develop this field together .
question no 38 by paul rübig ( h-0135/02 ) :
i shall give you some examples .
until now , bus and coach passengers were in a much worse situation .
that requires a united front .
that is the reason we opted for emissions trading .
not all meps are back in the chamber after the fire drill .
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
second , the question of cookies .
it must serve as an example .
on the contrary , we have to face it head on and try to respond to it .
shipping has been forgotten as an industry .
the post of high representative is a product of the lisbon treaty .
this is a question of solidarity that the whole of the eu would benefit from .
composition of parliament : see minutes
i would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of .
these are all very important elements .
innovation and creativity are known to be factors in growth .
the length of stay in the schengen area is limited to three months during any six - month period .
swift tells us that is not the case .
our group supports commissioner rehn 's position .
ladies and gentlemen , how can we talk of europe , its enlargement and solidarity ?
the code of conduct will be based on the following points :
we are only just preparing the pre - accession strategy .
i propose that we change this system .
and i should also like you to explain the following contradiction .
this is particularly applicable , of course , to emissions of greenhouse gases .
it is the cause of more ill health than malaria and road accidents combined .
the question now whether or not we can realise those objectives ?
i have one last point .
subject : safety of coastal communities from radioactive shipments
question no 23 by ( h-0838/01 ) :
this situation shows the problems we shall face .
solvency margin for insurance undertakings
we have to spread our assistance more generally than that .
the only thing we do not do is we do not publish votes .
we therefore trust this venture will be crowned with success .
we have this unique experience .
on all sides , in fact , the accumulated delay is considerable .
the debate is closed .
the commission services are working to improve this .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
i do not intend to go further into the facts and figures , as we have already heard a great deal on that score .
i fear , mr president , that this idea is more of a slogan than a proven fact .
it will also be difficult to tell companies how to spend their profits .
at the end of the day it is competition that makes the climate , not state aid .
the discrimination issue is just as glaringly obvious .
this is why this should also be included in this report .
mr   president , right now , everyone ’s attention is on the european parliament .
and we have already had bitter experience .
it seems to me that you have given a cautious response .
it has lost its purpose of acting as a contract between the 15 old member states .
however , this is not what the dominant forces in the eu want .
it is no different in other countries of the union .
that is explicitly stated in our report .
we of course urge her to do whatever more she can .
let me make a final remark .
what else can we do to support this opposition ?
thank you , commissioner reding .
attacks on catholics are increasing in vietnam .
they should not have been in rome .
we always get there too late , but sometimes we could have got there in time .
so how can we address this ?
those are very important questions .

( parliament approved the resolution )
mr pradier speaks of a necessary evil .
they should not target their commercial and advertising campaigns specifically at adolescents .

this monitoring mechanism serves a double purpose .
this is about ensuring the security of europe 's food supply .
the council president , the high representative or the commission president ?
the problem is made worse by the fact that member states have proved reluctant to transpose the directive into their national legislation .
now is the only time it actually can be discussed .
i would like to thank you for this opportunity .
as i have already said , the request would be made on a case - by - case basis .
that concludes the vote .
the other 70 000 chemicals we use would be dealt with under this legislation .
are we just writing rhetoric ?
there are many areas where action really needs to be taken by member states .
we will see that you have one for the vote on 28 january .
that has been achieved .
mr president , the situation in burma continues to deteriorate .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me just deal very briefly with some of the comments we have heard .
what is being said here is fraudulent .
once this point was resolved , however , the council was able to reach a political agreement .
early agreement on this package will be a welcome boost .
i should also like to mention the cooperation with mrs   lulling .
mr cohn - bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this .
if you were a troublesome critic of the regime , you would not be put on trial .
i will mention an example from indonesia that was asked of me .
let me to start with the current situation .
madam president , the citizens ' initiative has many guises .
our attempt has got to have a lasting effect , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you for this piece of information .
i hope at least this text will be approved .
in this process parliament ' s responsibility is very great indeed .
i hope that this house will support this approach .
up to now i have had nothing but praise for the danish council presidency .
( hu ) thank you , mr president .
soon after he had finished speaking , there were just as many empty seats on the socialist side as there are over here .
efforts at reform are an exclusively national matter .
the over - centralised , inflexible cfp has failed miserably and we must accept that .
all present member states must be included and make their contribution .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
but i did not want to back down as far as visibility is concerned .
there are too many differences between the member states today and that is not sustainable .
one thing is quite clear , namely that animal health equates with food safety .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
those who produce better quality will therefore be able to manage without subsidies at a later date .
of the 7   000 troops in nato ’s sfor , over 6   000 were european .
that is why we are also addressing these questions here , in order to strengthen the credibility of the pact .
however , i wish to reiterate our position on paragraphs 42 - 44 of the report .
the diversity of the european union is something to celebrate and not to eliminate .
that is a question that must be directed at the united states , in particular .
for that reason alone , i believe that this campaign was well worthwhile .
peace talks were suspended in august of last year .
but it must not be used as an alibi .
on 6 june , as i have already said , major progress was achieved in the council .
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
mrs ghilardotti makes the point well here .
for these reasons , i would urge my fellow members to vote in favour of the report .
my pig farmers do not want charity but they do want a chance .
the rest went to the lawyers .
the legislation must , however , be viable .

mrs oomen - ruijten , there will be no discussion on this matter .
i am disappointed in the way our partner , turkey , has behaved in this respect .
so , and i am saying this as a german , do not leave too much to the germans !
counterfeit medicines are manufactured and traded illegally without any form of supervision .
once again , the council is shirking its responsibility .
however , he is fundamentally wrong when he says this debate is not about china .
the member states should put an end to their involvement in the construction of the northern and southern pipelines at the earliest opportunity .
the council does not intend to take any action in this regard .
i now arrive at a crucial issue , the budget .
there are two particular issues that i want to draw attention to .

quite unilaterally , mr söderman grasped the nettle and was successful .
we are going to leave no margin .

the countries concerned will not be able to resolve this problem without our help .
at european level , our action must have genuine european added - value .
in view of the points described above , i felt compelled to vote in favour .
therefore , we voted in favour of the angelilli report today .
what we get instead is more talk of a treaty .
i agree , mr president , but as you know , here it is all politics .
mention just one which is written in language that the ordinary citizen can understand .
it concerns the problem ships that have been banned and phased out in europe .
as you know , the procedure comprises two stages .
in this regard , you have our support .
just what do these figures mean , however ?
that is dealt with by the green card bureaux .
that is the really regrettable feature of today 's debate .
farmers in my country are already suffering a huge decline in income .
nothing that has occurred in kosovo or anywhere else has diminished the significance of this .
what is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in chechnya ?
lisbon european council
full democratic and civil control of the military has also been introduced .
in addition , the report does not for a moment doubt the ' good intentions ' of the εu.
we have to move the debate forward .
in the spring , we debated this very subject further to mr stark 's appointment .
mr cashman has already said all that needs to be said about amendment no 17 .
certainly there would be other things to say , but i think i can leave it at that .
the debate is closed .
in my country there is a lot of discussion about healthcare at the moment .
we are not there yet .
my own country , scotland , does not currently have independent diplomatic representation anywhere in the world .

as my final point , i would like to draw attention to the issue of simplification .
i wish you success at the summit in vienna .
are the measures for the implementation of smart sanctions now in place ?
our group takes a very critical view of that .
i now turn to the house itself .

what steps will the council presidency take to ensure that these countries ratify the agreements ?
the next item is the statement by the president - designate of the commission .
that is what we must realize .
previous judgments give us very clear precedents .
mr president , hearsay can be dangerous .
therefore , it is not enough to condemn .
this does not mean , however , that an institution is in any way exempt from carrying out its responsibilities .
i wonder whether i would have an answer to that question .
we have done this up to now , and we will continue to do so .
i ask myself : how is that ?
for this double advantage , organic agriculture should be firmly encouraged .

the volcanic eruption in iceland should be a warning to all of us .
cooperation must operate in both directions — i repeat — in both directions .
thank you , sir leon .
that is what i think is somewhat lacking in the speeches made by the presidency and the commission .
consequently it was more realistic than in previous years .
enlargement negotiations are opened through unanimity .
this obviously has to happen through our members .
mr president , 15 - 19 january , 12 - 16 february , 11 - 15 march , 31 january - 1 february , 28 - 29 february , 27 - 28 march .

you should know this ; therefore i clearly and openly say so .
does the council agree that a supporting role from europe might be useful ?
currently , the commission is in the process of preparing such a report for cyprus .
madam president , commissioner , we are latecomers ; time is running away from us and , above all , from the galileo project .
i am pleased at the comments from the commissioner .
neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote .
madam president , i come with two questions for the commissioner .
the vote will take place today .

and as in goya ' s painting , ' the illusion of reason produces monsters ' .

we saw this in the case of fmd and we are witnessing it again now .
we have referred quite a number of complaints to it .
we shall treat that as an olive branch .
and lastly , i would like to refer to the way that negotiations are carried out .
accordingly , we have evolved our own system of controls .
the problem you have raised is a very real one .
it is also a real step forward that invitations to tender can be collated .
this would also allow us to spend the money in a more targeted way .
indeed this found expression in the number of people that could be employed locally through the european union .
it is a time to be smart and ambitious .
the problem is , however , now more pressing than ever before .
our objective is the transposition of the british golden rule to european level .
the process has always been complicated , but always constructive and very professional .
countless psychological traumas are another legacy of these exposures to violence .
it currently faces a number of challenges , as outlined by baroness ashton .
questions to mr monti
it inevitably led to misgrading .
first principle : equality .
leading the union means seeking a solution for greece .
this , however , is the theory .
- after the vote on paragraph 6 :
in addition , we can accept two amendments if we alter the wording slightly .
up to 2500 drug tests will be carried out during the sydney games .
author . - madam president , sri lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades .
why did we not put up a harder fight ?
the wfp has also announced that it is sending over 4 000 tonnes of basic foodstuffs .
let us involve the national parliaments in this communication process .
protection of animals during transport
do the council and the commission know exactly what turkey wants ?
one is definitely this house , but the other is the council .
another issue i want to concentrate on is nuclear energy .
only when the last dolphin has been freed is the net hauled on board .
electronic communications
there is broad support for this in this house .
. investigative work is being undertaken in conjunction with member states .
question no 38 by freddy blak ( h-0960/96 )
this is one of our great export earners .
of course i regret this .
the principle of subsidiarity must be our guide .
true , so far all we have to go on are words , which must be translated into deeds .
let us tell the truth in here .
we should not allow ourselves to get lost in debates about definitions and problems of measurement .
we were able to cooperate very closely on the day - to - day agendas .
in this way , solutions are being sought for their reintegration into the labour market .
i know the issue of ' snus ' is a sensitive one for one member state .
( pt ) over the last few years , every aspect of the travel industry has undergone profound changes .
the future of europe depends on it .
it is my view that we need some oecd agreements in this area .
thank you , sir leon .
on her behalf , i want to begin by thanking mrs echerer on a number of scores .
tourism remains a sleeping giant to a great extent in the member states .
this parliament can not ignore these crimes , and we should condemn these attacks .
has the union acted in the interests of all its citizens in the best possible way ?
we will not change the appalling behaviour of the dictators by words alone .
petitions : see minutes
another question is the dispute over the size of mackerel catches .
for the reverend owen , however , it is anything but obscure .
we hope this proposal will be welcomed .
it reflects the citizens ' ever growing interest in the question of water resources .
30 . european public administrations isa : interoperability solutions (
part of this debate deals with the commission 's roadmap .
coordination , when applied to economic policy , must not be a dirty word in these halls .
finally , i should like to refer to amendment no 1 which stands in the name of my group .
i did not vote .
it is a legitimate question , however , whether this regulation was even necessary .
do we really expect bosnia 's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today ?
russia 's current and future economy is built on the export of energy resources .
before the final vote
manifestos are there to be argued about : human rights should not be .
we have known that mercury is dangerous for a long time .
most people seem to be in agreement with this .
but i do agree that we need to be more efficient .
so i would ask the rapporteur , mr olsson , for his advice on this matter .
before we move on to the agenda , there is another announcement that i have to make to you .
it is all about the details : how is parliament to be involved ?
we must change and improve the systems of supervision and monitoring .
in 1996 , the commission proposed the ecological water directive , which did not amount to more than five pages , however .
it will contribute to a more stable , secure and stronger union .
they are aimed at different market sectors .
these are , therefore , not trifling matters .
but i am sure we welcome them as we do any other visitors .
( applause from the centre and from the left )
the directive has been negotiated since 1998 .
i am sure that the treaty will also be ratified by the czech republic .
without that there is not much in it at all .
we really must learn from that .
there is no reason why it can not answer all of the questions that have been asked today .
in what way are the reliable ngos involved in implementing the monitoring of these matters ?
. ( nl ) state aid has become a dirty word within the eu .
as mr cohn - bendit rightly said , there are indeed many last - minute resistance fighters .
approval of the minutes
this year , we are in a different situation .
what we have seen so far is that this is not happening .
. ( da ) we have certain objections to the resolution .
( the sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
the recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capital - intensive .
first of all , i want to take advice , listen , and then make proposals .
no progress is being made .
the debate is closed .
the list of demands should be given serious consideration .
this would amount to the prevention of racism !
that is why i am using the word ' person ' and not ' president ' .
my question concerns the services directive .
you too have told me that , mr commissioner .
it is the price of our fanatical rejection of nuclear energy .
this ought to be our challenge .
. i disagree , mr   rack .
his testimony illustrates african injustice .
the work was completed successfully .
this system is the reason why the proposed amendment is so important .
we are calling for european parliament involvement in the appointment and dismissal of europol 's director and deputy directors , and for two european parliament elected representatives to take part in the management board meetings . we are calling for full respect of parliament 's rights to be informed and consulted .
this is where much more use must be made of europol .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i also wish to briefly address the issue of hunting .
in my country , people have two concerns .
this goodwill on the part of our partner countries is certainly there , but to varying degrees .
therefore i agree with honourable member on that .
russia is an important market outlet for moldova 's winemakers .
we believe that all the member states should be obliged to take action in the field of equal treatment .
i echo your president 's words on that .
this decision is counter - productive and will help to strengthen hamas .
ladies and gentlemen , the situation is serious , though not hopeless .
they are allowed one family visit per month .
in the case of amendment no 13 , parliament is trying to introduce yet another exemption .
around 44 000 people are responsible for monetary policy in the european union .
we ought to know .
11 . civil liability and financial guarantees of shipowners (
and , as parliament knows , i have not been backward when it comes to enforcement .
madam president , first of all , i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
there is no evidence anywhere to suggest that the elderly are particularly unsafe drivers .
in order to achieve this , the reform is built on three axes .
they know that the eu is just such a monolith .
the report we are debating today is important for men and women .
mr takkula has asked permission to ask a question .
the commission proposes adding a new category of honey , filtered honey .
these last two conclusions are supported by mr hoppenstedt and we are grateful to him for that .
i did not give it to him on his second attempt to take the floor .
it has nothing whatever to do with the second part .
the circle from copenhagen to copenhagen is about to be closed .
it was you who voted for the rules of procedure , not i !
so we are not changing the legal system of the european union .
i appreciate what the honourable member has said .
with regard to the proposal to set up a democracy fund , this could provide added value .
in the end , we need a consolidated corporate tax base .
we can not tolerate this .
we need to separate the proposals contained in the morillon report rendered obsolete by recent developments , from those which are still relevant .
for many people it is less than the cost of a cup of coffee or a newspaper .
i am well aware that it is not possible to formulate everything in detail in a legislative text .
that gives us enormous potential leverage , and we should be using it .
very often , deceptive trade practices are also going on .
is it to be article 215 or article 75 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ?
this is what leads me to believe that we are on the right track .
we took years to intervene in bosnia : there was no oil .
what are our options according to my group ?
mr nordmann , i have already recorded your request for an oral amendment .
that said , we must not be under any illusions . there is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies .
we can not leave it at that , however .
the union 's position is plain .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday , 10 march 2010 .
that did not happen during the 1930s .
will it be budgetised within the eu 's normal financial procedures ?
therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of parliament .
it is therefore absolutely vital that we continue to call for nuclear disarmament .
i have to have an agreement with him on this .
therefore , we still need to wait for the commission 's specific proposals .
by including this benefit in the list , this benefit is repealed immediately .
the purpose is to agree common definitions of crimes , and agree on prosecution and legal consequences .
mr   sterckx also talked about third countries .
question no 8 by ( h-0694/99 ) :
congratulations again to both rapporteurs .
that was also noted in the discussions in council .
this has also attracted the broad support of member states .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
we should be satisfied with the end result .
mrs read put a question about the balance between competition and regulation .
this ends my digression into domestic affairs .
despite all this , i still have to present my report to you .
the important thing is that words are not enough : we need deeds to make europe a reality .
i welcome what the commission has said today .
there is not enough in the bank account .
the iranians themselves must perform this task .
it does mean , however , that food safety must be at the top of the agenda .
the commissioner has mentioned the positive approach .
the way in which the tests are funded varies from country to country .
we are not talking about parliament 's money , but taxpayers ' money .
let me mention just two of the recommendations in the report .
it is still a delay but it is much less serious than we feared .
i think we must be able to adopt the commission 's proposals .
transit traffic in a sensitive alpine region is the secondary issue .
we have also looked to provide positive indications .
my group therefore resoundingly rejects the directive .
it will boost europeans ' confidence in the schengen area .
mr president , the services directive has been consistently opposed by my party .
that was another point i wanted to make .
we basques want peace and we want to find a lasting solution which is acceptable to everyone .
we have a big choice to make .
yes , that is also laid down in the treaty .
i think you understand me .
it is possible , but not compulsory .
obviously , on some points , improvement is possible .
i will follow the advice of the rapporteur .
it is not by chance that they are at the impasse they have reached .
the likelihood of an accident varies widely among different regions and continents .
the same goes for the pvc strategy .
cooperation is also required .
french troops are already deployed in chad .
there is also a major challenge to be met in terms of training fire - fighters and rescue forces .
it therefore seems clear that we still have a long way to go .
i believe that israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of lebanon .
in that way we create a system which has a high degree of legitimacy and is democratically anchored .
we could not agree to the splitting of a single fisheries stock .
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .
this is important , because europe needs an institutional settlement .
of course we can consider the situation in terms of existing needs .
this is not really the same as competition .
in my country , 80 % of the people are baptised and wear a cross their whole life .
no region in the european union is shoved to one side .
now , what that suggests is a certain conceptual lack of clarity .
thank you very much , commissioner monti .
let us hope that prague castle is soon occupied once more by someone as european as this .
that very biodiversity is crucial .
mr president , economies differ - that is just a fact .
a lot of members are still indicating they wish to speak .
the political ramifications of their intention are , however , a missed opportunity .
on that point the intention behind the fifth framework programme is satisfactory .
21 . 2007 discharge : european police college (
therefore , to both of your additional questions the answer is - yes .
as a consequence it has vitiated the traditional notion of property rights .
to what extent , therefore , is the commission involved in the proposed convention ?
the violence and persecution that continue in kosovo is only to be condemned .
the answer is far too little , far too timidly .
they must understand what they are paying for .
i got the impression , mr barroso , that you said ‘ let us give it a try’ .
the other developed states have nothing to reproach us for .
so you want to impart new impetus to europe , mr   president - in - office ?
special , do not even think about it .
that is our second trump card .
i can therefore support the essence of the lines the committee has taken .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
so far , i have not put that willingness to the test with a number of governments .
no one is denying that .
no one had this information .
the businessmen of taiwan and the european union have found their own way .
however , i do think some reservations are in order , especially on the subject of agencies .
we do indeed lack a legal basis .
mr president , current rates of development are not absorbing the high level of unemployment .
the vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
i think it would be a disgrace if it were approved .
the debate is closed .
that company is relocating 500 jobs to bulgaria .
what has become of their impetus ?
there is one criticism , however , which was voiced today , and i am surprised by it .
please prepare for your visit to ireland .
results in the member states where postal reform has been more rapid demonstrate this fact .
important questions have been raised here , some of which relate to the milk crisis .
having had so much experience of military build - up , though , they surely ought to know what they are talking about .
that was to keep pressure on companies to decrease their emissions .
we must also take into account that the local authorities will suffer some loss of income .
the role of the eib is important .
we need to ensure that the same thing does not happen this year .
after all , europe also has interests that it pursues in the black sea region .
i do not want the lisbon treaty , or a common immigration and asylum policy .
we can contribute to that ourselves .
many of them are good .
we should therefore support the wording proposed by the european commission .
to what extent is the commission aware of this problem ?
mr president , i congratulate you .
deadlines are necessary to force action .
that is referred from the milan court .
how could sport in europe exist without these people ?
his report is an encouragement of the use of nuclear energy .
this provision is purely declaratory in nature and is included for the purpose of clarification .
we hope this mission will be dispatched without delay .
unfortunately , that has proved impossible .
madam president , the european people 's party is very pleased by today 's debate .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minutes
its work programme is hard and extraordinarily important .
we invite you when we have a codecision process .
i believe that this parliament has conducted itself with dignity .
i have a very specific question for the commission and the council president .
we have to do it .
despite this , i do think that we have not solved the problem by a long way .
this would be a strong signal , which would be meaningful .
it breaks new ground , but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it .
sometimes calmer , at other times violent , this crisis has no end .
( parliament accepted the oral amendment )
last year 's budget was eur 50 million .
that is unfortunately not the case .
we all need to open our minds .
so a european surveillance centre , a european observatory would be created .
the ethnic cleansing in kosovo is getting worse .
france changed its constitution so that the ecb could be independent .
we should like to restore this again through a motion .
they both aim to achieve the same thing .
secondly : no traffic should be diverted .
that is what will happen , mr simpson , and i refuse to accept any responsibility for it .
– mr president , i should like to congratulate mr garot on his report .
unfortunately , my background is not that of an actor .
as a dane , i was naturally interested in what it had to say about denmark .
if there is a real political will in the council , it can be done .
this is one of the questions that have to be resolved .
the commission can not accept amendments 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 and 11 .
up to this point , there is consensus among us .
this phenomenon can , and indeed should , be stopped without delay .
the most pressing issue is undoubtedly the question of migration flows .
that is something we can not accept .
the debate is closed .
this house faces a heavy choice .
it is right for us here in this house to draw attention to it .
we should , however , not lose sight of the fact that there is still a long way to go .
the first series of issues relates to the coherence of the community ’s actions .
on this issue , the industry lobby unfortunately won , both in the council and in parliament .
i am agog to know what will transpire .
new jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced .
security in europe is not possible in opposition to russia , but only in collaboration with it .
the form it takes and its name are unimportant .
we must not throw good money after bad .
this fear is not necessary .
we need to find something better .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
according to a document from the commission , they are 500 times higher than normal in europe .
( fr ) i shall try again .
the voting will take place at 5.30 p.m. today .
how can they actively oppose that ?
these are not fine words . it is what is actually happening in the field .
although it is a very general paper , it is still important .
the commission can also approve amendment no 26 with certain editorial changes .
by regions , i also mean the people that live in these regions .
that seems to me to be very important .
in the annual report itself , we tackle the question of durum wheat , amongst other things .
we always wanted there to be a gender balance in the youth parliament .
i think that we should begin by considering the proposed financial framework .
i have never believed in ' fortress europe ' .
on the other hand , it is , indeed , an open - ended process .
they should be called to account .
had we been able to do that , we would have been able to eliminate poverty faster .
you are right to say that discussion of these issues is among our responsibilities .
commissioner , the least protected open markets are also the most vulnerable .
this declaration to the constitution would be rendered meaningless .
the basic question is what does this directive defend ?
in eastern europe frustration is growing at the eu 's hesitant attitude .
that is why i voted in favour of the present resolution .
how will things go next year ?
information and knowledge are the raw material in this society and the source of new wealth .
one hand does n't seem to know what the other is doing .
the aim of that agreement is the increased liberalization and expansion of world trade .
all of these are new developments that are , as a minimum , absolutely necessary .
the report notes that there is an additional need for more money for the visitors ' centre .
that is an important step for a comprehensive guarantee of food safety .
the debate is closed .
yes , we debate it here , but realistically we can change nothing .
some people have questioned whether we are not being overly critical .
and we have given the automobile industries six months to reach an agreement .
however , what we have here is a compromise solution .
for this reason i am in favour of the garosci report .
a greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues .
in any event , we must nevertheless enhance the status of fridays .
in principle , however , the ppe - de group is in favour of amendment .
fourthly , we should carry out an ongoing risk analysis .
as we all know , it will not .
but far less attention is paid to economic crime .
president . - as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
i say that also for us to have an idea of the order of magnitude .
politicians have been trying for years to negotiate a compromise acceptable to everyone .
breaking out of this vicious circle will prove to be very difficult .
( pl ) mr president , i voted in favour of the costa report .
i am not worried about voting for the dell'alba report .
in view of the circumstances , there was reason to fear the worst .
( mt ) mr president , i too will be speaking about immigration .
they had been prepared by officials and by the outgoing parliament .
it follows that russia should recognise where its real , long - term interests lie .
if you can take that on board , then i think we can have a reasonable dialogue with each other .
president - in - office of the council .
this is the third year that we have launched the budget together .
the commission acknowledges that parliament is already engaged in this effort .
that is a completely new factor and i should like to know your opinion of it .
that is why the current regime simply has to be changed .
( parliament approved the minutes )
thus we shall acquire ‘ more and better jobs’ !
mr von boetticher , we will not be debating the content of the amendments during the voting .
we could do that .
that issue was raised in the council and many member states strongly contested that position .
these are the human rights of the new , the third generation .
a further project is the planned green paper on agricultural product quality .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy practically anticipated the council .
the economic balance - sheet is also broadly positive for the partner countries .
then appropriate decisions can be made in the light of that situation .
the modified lisbon strategy does not bring anything that is very new .
in the world of politics , we sometimes find ourselves dealing with " deceptive packaging " .
we want stability programmes to be submitted annually for a two - year period ; yet again , this proposal was rejected .
he has got what he wanted .
practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally .
it is all the more disturbing because it reveals a constant state of mind in brussels .
we defend our ideals with our own convictions .
corporate social responsibility ( debate )
he will of course need a certain time for implementation .
it is very important that we put these foundations in place .
i should like to ask the commissioner one question .
the english version of paragraph 17 should therefore be taken as authentic .
( pl ) thank you , mr president .
the first one is transport .
small and medium - sized enterprises have a very special role to play in this .
the commission still has to devise all these arrangements .
let us not repeat the same mistake .
question no 48 by brian crowley ( h-1146/98 )
the same applies to the reduction in the supply of drugs .
special missions will of course also be sent to turkey in the event that this is necessary .
independent testing is necessary in this regard .
the debate is closed .
this sector is of considerable importance for intercultural dialogue .
these environmental accounts can help us in this regard .
the european union has a major responsibility for the future of kosovo .
all i can see is a great deal of chaos and insecurity in my country .
we have discovered hundreds of errors – errors both of form and of substance .
commissioner , i would like you to support this idea .
i want to see as many issues as possible resolved quickly .
let me just correct something which has been said .
mr president , i wish you all the best , both personally and politically .
this question therefore did not apply to ireland , which has fulfilled its obligations .
we were cruelly disappointed .
let us not give in to unfounded fears .
this has been scientifically proven .
if we are to introduce special rules for vulnerable areas , they must apply to all of them .
maybe that is an area where we could better invest the eur 55 million .
we welcome this definition , because it is often advertising that leads purchasers to buy .
it was adopted before the single european act came into force .
how does the general budget situation look prior to the autumn budget procedure ?
indeed , the framework directive has 22 years of research behind it .
often there are no sports fields or crèches and few shops .
violence in karachi has increased .
the european parliament is not the place to resolve these problems .
i regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one .
i believe that mr   yushchenko ’s victory is a victory for our european values .
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
agenda for next part session : see minutes
the eu 's maritime policy will be a good opportunity for cooperation among the member states .
a number of these actions have already been taken .
( parliament adopted the decision )
mrs andré - leonard stressed that just a couple of minutes ago .
( for outcome and other details of the vote : see minutes )
globalisation , liberalisation and deregulation are not synonymous .
( b5 - 0773/2001 ) by van den berg and sauquillo pérez del arco , on behalf of the pse group ;
it contains a very good overview of the measures which need to be taken in this field .
for my part , i think it is a terrible document .
madam president , i have a question for mr monti on amendment 49 .
in this context , setting up eurojust is a bold initiative .
well , for ireland the challenges are particularly great .
first of all , we need simplified arrangements and less red tape .
the ombudsman has proposed to lift the secrecy exception for access to a file .
unfortunately , the political will has been absent .
i should also like to say : do not overlook corruption .
rather , we must reach conclusions .
clearly , such a state of affairs can not be allowed to continue .
i listened with great interest to what the commissioner said about time spent on remand .
currently , this can not be sufficiently achieved or is not being sufficiently achieved .
i hope that we will get to that , and believe that it is high time we did .
we really must now make use of the opportunities offered by the new treaty of lisbon , too .
it is essential that the commission provide an impact assessment on this agreement .
we were the first to publish an introductory statement which is our diagnosis of the situation .
in this field too , which is of outstanding importance to europe , israel has made great advances .
following enlargement of the european union , the community is studying the situation concerning red fruits .
we have taken the floor on many occasions .
this is a start .
what can be done ?
the eu is not news .
the russian embargo on polish meat was a case in point .
we do not know if these deadlines will be respected .
and what actions have the indians themselves taken ?
two of my sons speak polish .
this considerably restricts their mobility .
let me first run you through the main issues on the agenda of the european council .
you have , i might add , been warmly applauded on all sides of the chamber .
the usa has had a ban for many years .
there is only one that is not acceptable to the commission .
this requires clear labelling in all circumstances .
yet another supranational body .
in my opinion , this matter should be discussed in parliament .
i would ask for this correction to be made .
the 1999 revision has included a further 17 projects .
we are looking at this .
our group has other reasons for rejecting the report .
i have not spoken for three and a half minutes yet !
the vote will be at noon .
decision on urgency
that is always clearly understood .
( parliament approved the oral amendment )
the union therefore has little power of its own to influence policy in this area .
ten new countries are about to join .
moreover , this directive will simplify admission procedures for employment purposes .
we meps take the view that there are two principles that must be adhered to .
in this sense we are responding to two of the rapporteur 's main recommendations .
would this not be an alternative solution ?
agenda for next sitting : see minutes
but women are not the source of the actual problem .
i thank mr malerba for his excellent report .
that is not my information .
let me now turn to the first question .
mr president , we wish to table an oral amendment to the fourth indent .
we hope that the commission and the council will take account of these efforts .
but in turn , we also have our own requirements .
3 . south korea - death penalty declared legal
negotiations are also under way for a new association agreement with algeria .
there was only a brief discussion in the council working group , which was not conclusive .
in my country it is around 30 % .
- before the vote :
we have known that here the whole time .
as i have already said , the commission and parliament agree on this important issue .
this is inherent in the patent system .
there are already a few sections in this agreement relating to fishing matters .
the shipbuilding industry is one example .
it was being used against the european union , cited as an effort to invade everybody 's privacy .
the current rotating presidency gives priority to strengthening this partnership .
regarding amendment no 4
at the end of the day , however , which of us is still great ?
in a word , are the inhabitants of these countries a single people ?
this will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our union is about .
they are now identified as being part of ec waters ' .
the commission has declined to respond to any of the questions that have been put .
so , members of old europe , committed europeans , back to work ! with enthusiasm !
let us only hope and pray that these promises become more than mere words .
let me just take a slightly different tack to that pursued by a number of the previous speakers .
the european parliament supported the campaign to outlaw landmines from the very beginning .
we see the costs piling up , but there are also opportunities with such a development .
it seems to me that the us electoral calendar is dictating the timetable for the wto negotiations .
you specified a number of initiatives which apply to europe .
for this we do not need the return of national border controls .
governments will always complain and criticise you , but they need you .
as you know , there are three groups in this parliament , as has been seen clearly today .
so i feel that meps have delivered on those two aims .
we need more international cooperation between law enforcement agencies .
it would have benefited from the structural funds , amongst other things .
i should like to make a few suggestions in this respect .
europeans should not be afraid of this .
i ask you to vote in favour of its adoption .
before this takes place , though , they must meet certain criteria , which must continue to apply .
new office technologies can not be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either .
it is important where russia is concerned that we try to get beyond the headlines .
i have to say that the union is punching above its weight .
is it still serious about the roadmap ?
thank you , mr milinkievitch .
that is not so in this case , thanks to the colleagues who have made it possible .
like everybody else , we were taken by surprise .
i believe this must be active through the second pillar of the cap .
i believe that you will have received a reply from the president , which has probably been sent by fax .
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .
there can be no half - truths .
transfers of appropriations : see minutes
first , we had a long discussion in the euro group with the 12 .
i am talking particularly about whole - body vibration aspects , rather than hand and arm vibration .
i expect an answer from you , mr president - inoffice .
i underline that this is about the community as a whole .
otherwise we would have a poor image of this europe , which i do not think anybody wants .
it remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved .
a portion of the subsidised amounts will be integrated into the direct payments under regulation   1782/2003 .
let us stick to what the consumer knows and write it on the label .
the ban on polish food imports into russia has been in place for almost six months now .
that person was carmelo soria , an international official of the united nations .
this extreme urbanisation has resulted in a number of conflicts .
today , we should focus on articles 5 and 6 of the council decision .
the council must now stop playing games with labour rights in europe .
this legislation is a piece of civil , not criminal , law .
( the oral amendment was not accepted . )
mr president , in principle , on each occasion you quote the opinion of the rapporteur .
we can not remain indifferent to the infringement of democratic principles .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to endorse what one of the previous speakers said .
i believe that sport has the power to transform lives .
question no 52 by glenys kinnock ( h-0781/98 )
however , what is your vision for cooperation with the european parliament , which is a co - legislator ?
all this would not have been possible without financial solidarity .
the time for decision is nearly upon us , but we must remain vigilant .
member of the commission . i have read mr bontempi 's report on corruption with great interest .
in that respect , as rapporteur i should like to underline a few fundamental points :
you said that you were wholly responsible for putting the new team together .
it is exactly those who have now turned their backs on solidarity and on us all .
we also have the incomplete harmonisation of copyright law .
the proposal made by baroness ashton is unacceptable .
the debate is closed .
for example , we have to make sure that the peer review mechanism is safeguarded .
i believe that this threatens the peace process .
that was the end of his desire to get closer to the people through openness and democracy .
against this backdrop , we could not vote in favour of this report .
can i put the following proposal to you ?
the abuse and oppression of those who criticise the occupying power continues .
we need to discuss thursday afternoon 's agenda .
we had asked for ecu 7 million instead of ecu 3.9 million .
the proposal will , of course , build on experience gained from the first programme .
europe is a community of values .
it will tie up the industry in red tape .
the single market helps create the potential for such growth .
as for the report , it reeks of hypocrisy , and that is why we voted against it .
in total , 3920 complaints were received , a 5 % increase compared to the previous year .
the motto chosen by the hungarian presidency is thus a very appropriate and good one .
citizens and ourselves should not be fooled .
i fervently hope that the ukrainian government will give its cooperation .
our group will be supporting this report .
we have had the partial lifting of the ban which i welcome .
it has essentially ensured greater transparency in the decisionmaking process .
it improves the position of consumers within the internal market for services .
it comes late and its legal value is uncertain .
how successful we will be in the global competition arising from this depends on us .
the political debate must focus on absorption capacity .
at its first reading , the council retained the figures in the preliminary draft budget .
certain member states have , however , failed to meet the deadlines set .
you have agreed that there will be an investigation .
in this respect , your own contribution , mr dimas , has been substantial .
those conditions are most certainly linked to the modernisation of school education systems .
euro - mediterranean cooperation ( continuation )
their citizens deserve it .
this can be done by allowing collective agreements and cooperation between the social partners to play a more significant role .
what is more obvious than adequate input of the european member states to nato ?
we hope of course that a peaceful solution can be found .
before the vote on paragraph 5
it is therefore time for crisis strategy 2.0 .
the council has not yet completed its examination of this proposal .
a detailed proposal on this has already been submitted .
i wonder what the real outcome was .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
i would like to link the two and to emphasise the importance of such a link .
statement by the president
it takes many years to get energy facilities up and running .
however , i do not share the view that we meps need more staff .
i come now to some comments that i wanted to make .
i would have no trouble with supporting an amendment in this respect .
mr president , i believe it is true to say that there is little that matters to citizens as much as feeling safe and secure in the country in which they live or reside .
only forty or so amendments were tabled .
this should be a condition for membership of the union .
in writing . - in favour .
presentation of the czech presidency 's programme ( debate )
this should not be a temporary but permanent measure .
so pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong !
it is to be expected that capacity will increase to 160 billion cubic metres per annum by 2010 .
mr president , i would like to put a question to parliament .
this is the classic scapegoat phenomenon .
the second field is biotechnology .
in this context , we have to decide what we wish to have .
we should export on the hook and not the hoof .
the debate is closed .
monterrey dealt with financing in march 2002 .
at the end of last week , more than 1 100 people had already lost their lives .
mr president , this confusion just goes to show how odd these rules of procedure actually are .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
in this respect parliament is perhaps attempting to achieve rather overambitious objectives too quickly .
transparency is vital to the public .
institutions for occupational retirement provision
i would like to congratulate you and the committee on it .
this should be changed into a plus sign in both instances , just so as to make matters absolutely clear .
mr president , this is the third time the boat has put out to sea .
however , very much to the contrary , as shown by this report 's shameless ambition .
the return directive is an important aspect of the fight against illegal immigration .
therefore , it must be functioning properly , also in respect of those who ultimately have to use it .
we should not forget an important element , namely the introduction of a control procedure .
the reality is that it is a complex issue with formidable challenges .
i would like , at this juncture , to briefly jump ahead and say that advertising does not make people fat .
mr president , i am delighted that this programme submitted by the commission should now be under scrutiny .
we are well aware of the gradual slippage of investment products .
sometimes we are not successful in everything .
it is not just a question of farmers failing to make a living .
europe has in fact had a good deal of involvement in the region we are discussing .
we all need to continue making efforts in this respect .
they are also asking the industrialised countries for help in overcoming their y2 k problem .
pollack report ( a4 - 0161/98 )
this freedom is also our freedom and it is a guarantee of the free exercise of our mandate .
this , indeed , is precisely the reason why the european commission has published a green paper .
i believe that recently such noises are heard too infrequently .
we all claim to be honest , and we are certainly all trustworthy – no doubt about that .
president   saakashvili ’s mandate is also a time of great hope for the entire georgian people .
as we know , the presence of large quantities of weapons can in itself trigger a spiral of violence .
mr swoboda , we would have come to that when we got to that item on the agenda .
membership of committees ( deadline for tabling amendments ) : see minutes
in principle , fiscal measures are a matter governed by national sovereignty .
but if all that is such a matter of course , why does this european union not act on it ?
three speakers spoke against the criticism of the tunisian government .
in fact , european citizenship is highly artificial in nature .
that makes it very difficult to control .
let us not move away from that .
the i-2010 framework thus seeks to provide a future - proof policy framework .
we have the internal market .
like the entire population of europe , i wonder what they are doing .
the first field is the youth programme .
the public has not appreciated this and is not sufficiently aware of it .
publication in the official journal is mandatory .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
the eu can not bear the responsibility for the entire world alone .
we , as a group , set great store by providing a definition in this connection .
i am also in favour of the differentiated granting of quotas that you propose .
this is perhaps one of the things we are to be tackling .
human rights violations are raised whenever they occur .
– the debate is closed .
the citizens are given less and less opportunity to get involved in government policy .
we therefore need to have the courage to find a realistic solution .
in comparison with whom should we be competitive ?
i wish to comment on the most important amendments before the house .
every individual has but one life and that life deserves to be protected .
the next belgian presidency is in the year 2001 .
brussels already has a reputation for allowing the major corporations to call the shots and pull the strings .
what i really had in mind is that we need continuity .
it is right that we need a long - term strategy .
not only the most important intersections in fact , but also by definition points where intermodal transport takes place .
the second was about voting on motions for resolutions on passenger compensation .
there are weaknesses in those methodologies .
thank you for your answer , which i think was important and valuable .
the european parliament needs to be associated as closely as possible with the shaping of the policy .
this is an important policy basis .
cruelty to animals is unworthy of us humans .
mr president , my amendment , which has now been accepted , was to be added to paragraph 16 .
first of all , we are dealing with a government that was not democratically elected .
i am glad that the dutch prime minister has realised this .
indeed , the figures have worsened in recent years : 854 million people ( 17 % of the world 's population ) per day suffer from hunger and almost 16 000 children die every day due to hunger - related causes .
we are familiar with the fears of the people who are waiting to find out about the decision to be made in america .
i shall expect a response from the commission .
mr president , the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is a very timely one .
let me conclude by extending my personal thanks to the rapporteur .
we have been waiting for it for too long now .
the commission is seeking a reduction in the list of 39 data elements from the united states .
since essen , we have had numerous declarations of intent and well - meant action programmes .
what is behind the proposal instead is , in essence , interruptions in supplies to the eu market .
it should not be allowed to disappear , and we therefore think it is important that it should receive specific mention .
this can lead to the poverty continuing , so that they also end up poor in old age .
finally , i would still advocate a strong country of origin principle .
we should have no illusions : globalisation also means deep changes in the world balance of power .
age limits ought not to be rigidly adhered .
you have the floor , mr daul .
surely more is needed than has been offered in the statement today .
this is to make another mistake , and for three reasons .
i am used to performing several roles , but this would be a new one for me .
this is the gift of life .
we must urge everybody to play their part in the multilateral structures .
this applies especially to the puebla panama project .
i will , however , allow you to make a point of order .
i hope this approach will be looked upon favourably .
i do not therefore intend to repeat arguments which i accept overall .
their relations have not always been honest .
from a finnish point of view , i am really pleased to see scandinavian colours in the presidency .
i am sure you will understand .
the leaders of albania must act now for the benefit of their people .
i would like to say that i deplore the sluggish progress on this question in the council .
indeed you even wanted to continue cancelling the largely inadequate anti - dumping instruments !
there are a number of stumbling blocks on the road to possible eu membership .
do n't worry , mr areitio toledo , this is not an end but a beginning .
i voted in favour of this report .
otherwise , please allow me to make certain criticisms in relation to laeken .
seen from this point of view , it is good if we already start making appropriate preparations now .
the world and the people who are looked after ...
however , i have taken the pragmatic view .
the next item is the joint debate on :
as regards " catch - the - eye " , what is on the table is a compromise .
i agree with those who have said that propaganda will not work .
these are the reasons why i have voted against the report .
now i must say a few words about the impacts of globalisation .
( parliament rejected the request )
this could be an opportunity to open a broad debate on the matter .
for you know as well as i do that there are quite a few of these in europe .
ippc affects almost all sectors of industry .
mr president , on a point of order .
i ask for the house ’s backing for it .
it is not up to the european union to do all of that itself , but it must do it .
we must hold on to this , otherwise there will be no further progress .
i believe that i can put the rapporteur ' s mind at rest .
firstly , i will reply to mr jarzembowski .
the eu is open to further discussions with the usa relating to these projects .
the debate is closed .
on amendment no 106
it is not an unfair price to be paid by imposition on developing countries .
this new policy should therefore be part of a global vision .
trafficking in women is a crime and a modern form of slavery .
a separate decision will have to be taken on that , when this country meets the conditions .
i am grateful to mrs gradin for the explanations she has provided , and i agree entirely with her .
every 1 % reduction in road deaths should act as a spur .
the fight against this scourge ought to be an immediate priority .
the commission will be closely monitoring the implementation of this provision .
it has shielded our citizens from economic turbulences .
these matters are obviously important , but they are extremely closely linked to human rights .
in other words , it is about competences and the judicious application of the subsidiarity principle .
i give the floor to mr verheugen to answer these four questions .
i shall give you just a brief indication on where we are going .
that applies to the use of structural funds .
the strategies in the lisbon agenda are the guarantee of europe ’s future .
what purpose , madam commissioner ?
we must also ask ourselves the question : who , then , actually creates jobs ?
now , once again , we face the same situation .
christians in the middle east have survived 1 200 years under islamic rule .
i would like to second what ms de lange said about those .
in light of the demographic crisis , every child 's life has a price put on it .
in the near future there will be only the number 116000 for missing children , and so on .
i think that that is the question to which the commission must respond .
i voted against the resolution for several reasons .
we were already aware of that in early 1996 .
i am talking about article 17 of the treaty .
commissioner , today i have to accuse you of hostility to industry .
i would like to thank you for your reply .
last night during the debate on the oral question the council was absent .
the eu will continue to follow the developments in this area .
however , such niceties are being ignored .
that means that the method is important .
i hope it is not war .
that is what is most important to us today .
we hope that we might be able to work out satisfactory action plans by next year .
you yourself can establish whether the quorum is present .
nearly a sixth of the french state 's budget is spent on paying interest on its debt .
this decision is particularly important for dublin .
it also condemns all violence against women .
one more comment on financing : in my opinion , modulation is not a nice word .
the speaker is absolutely right : i thought the answer from the council was not sufficient .
furthermore , things moved slowly when it came to using the internet .
and if we are being honest , that is true to a certain extent .
a pure internal market approach will not get us anywhere with these issues .
we should reject violence and pay tribute to the victims of gaza and the west bank .
it is women who are at a particular disadvantage .
we have already discussed this in another context .
they can not go unpunished .
first , there is research and development .
it should focus only on investments in the common european future .
i therefore hope that you will really take action .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
so if the projects are there they are very welcome .
take the example of summer pasturing in the alps .
i am grateful to you for that .
the development of rural areas plays an ever greater role .
syria arms the hizbollah militias in their war - which it firmly controls - against israel .
at least for those countries , like the netherlands , that wish to do so .
what i find particularly deplorable is the question of exporting .
those rules apply and are also enforced within the union .
these are issues to which the european council must pay the greatest possible attention .
i believe that the legislative authority had a clear aim in choosing this formulation .
mr president , there are many extremely good points in this resolution .
the issue of our roots also remains unresolved .
this should all be exploited in our future cooperation based on the relevant agreements .
internal olaf investigations
portugal had banned companies from providing games of chance on the internet .
of course , the european institutions are not perfect .
for the time being , then , we have a working group .
i hope that will happen in april .
i would like to conclude with two more comments .
we also welcome the immense work of the rapporteur , mr   guerreiro .
it must make a positive contribution to resolving the conflict , insofar as it is able .
food prices have risen as well due to the growing consumption of biofuels .
that is primarily what we are voting on .
we should not be setting standards for these things .
the last time it was three degrees warmer than now , the surface of the sea was 10 metres higher .
we will try to do that , mrs díez de rivera icaza .
the employer would not be in a position to provide the relevant evidence .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minutes
the system currently used for accounting is sincom 2 .
around 100 million europeans are living in or on the threshold of poverty .
i am going to give you the floor , but you have just one minute .
mr president , there was one point which the commissioner made that i did not entirely understand .
he should be congratulated on all that , because he has brought excellent conclusions into this report .
in this regard , i am increasingly concerned about the issue of the exclusions .
that is what i wanted to say .
if you had come clean about it , we would not have needed a committee of inquiry .
my amendments aim to make a few changes to that effect .
we shall therefore work with them gladly .
their assault focuses in particular on three things .
let me explain how i arrived at this image .
that is why we must reaffirm the importance of public service broadcasting .
a transfer of funding requires the consent of all the commissioners .
there are all sorts of reasons .
it is never ever based on demos .
the proposals in their current shape simply can not survive .
you correctly state rule 114 .
transport , however , also needs to take the issue of carbon dioxide emissions seriously .
the motto ‘ equal pay for equal work’ has already been mentioned .
good luck , president sarkozy .
the new ministers are being sworn into office today .
overall , the commission 's proposals are balanced .
this in turn could increase public dissatisfaction with the eu .
signature of acts adopted under codecision : see minutes
secondly , it is the first budget of an enlarged european union , a union of the 27 member states .
we are on the right track , but unfortunately we have not yet reached our goal .
these steps should be supported by the commission and council .
we shall therefore abstain from voting on the regulation .
israel provides a good example of this .
it is valuable work , which we must keep up in the coming months .
i would therefore like to ask you your position on the creation of such a department .
is it not deplorable that in the state i belong to there is almost no attempt to inform ?
on friday mornings there are no television cameras .
that is not renewable energy .
four basic questions arise here .
women are repeatedly the victims of unjust and offensive court verdicts .
we who live on the border with eastern europe know these countries very well .
the drugs problems requires pragmatism and an open mind .
the articles are very different in each case .
we have to get used to various references which are virtually clerical .
i hope the house will support it in the vote .
the message of egypt is a message for the whole arab world .
i think the commissioner has no intention of doing anything else .
these changes will simplify the expenditure justification procedure .
it is not the commission 's aim to concern itself with this area .
i believe that mr tannock wished to speak .
consequently , i voted to reject the commission 's legislative proposal .
the belgian prime minister is familiar with the issue and he has his own views on the matter .
this is just what is being emphasised in this proposal .
consequently , it is certain and clear that democracy is also established there .
mrs schroedter certainly has understood what cohesion is .
bio - waste accounts for approximately 30 % of urban solid waste .
human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society .
less words and more work : legislation is work .
mr president , this business is even more bizarre .
in fact , austria was always seen as the blue - eyed boy in matters of human rights and democracy .
but on top of that comes a political concern .
we must also open our markets for products with value added from those poor countries .
this could also be extended to the entire eu .
borders are extremely porous .
i would just like to put that straight and i have now done so .
of course we do not give discharge to the member states , we give it to the commission .
the public sector is doubly important .
it is precisely for this reason that we need strict controls in the maritime transport sector .
it has said that they can be ready in time .
zimbabwe should therefore be refused readmission to the kimberley process .
development of the railways , however , was far too late in getting started .
bosnia - herzegovina is a special case .
first , that it affects only a small number of eu citizens .
and here , the european union must continue to play a key role .
it is full of lies and deception !
all this sits rather uneasily with endless lists .
over the last three years we have provided assistance of some eur 10 million annually .
the issue of an additional 2 % quota increase is , on the other hand , debatable .
this overturns the balance in the services sector .
mr president , well - trained computer programmers are much needed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates , in other words in a moment .
that means that the union can not respond to the terrorist threat .
these are the european council ’s main challenges .
they must act and give us the resources for implementing this much - vaunted policy .
public opinion is unprepared and uninformed .
that has to be acknowledged once and for all .
thank you , mr president .
so far the national courts have done so in some twenty cases .
thank you , commissioner cioloş .
mr patakis , you will have to go and get another voting card .
madam president , this is not a resolution against the cuban people .
but none the less that resentment is there .
there is never a higher , impartial body that investigates exactly what has happened .
what instruments and what incentive programmes are to be used to do this ?
individual member states should decide on the funding .
approval of the minutes
simple measures are usually far more effective than long - winded programmes .
i repeat that we know we will remain a net contributor .
that would be a new kind of magic .
this approach should also be continued .
in honduras , 90 % of the banana harvest has been ruined and 70 % of the roads are destroyed .
in other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .
i said that the council never comments on press reports .
we can not allow ourselves to be no more than carriers of advertising for nanotechnology .
subject : ' revolving door ' immigration policy
so that is why i have abstained on the report .
high representative , this time has long arrived .
that is it , really .
there are also a few things wrong with the organisation of the asap on the policy side .
we support this , but with dedicated rules , which there did used to be in the past .
exactly how much is the eu expecting the british taxpayer to pay , and is this legal ?
it has already been mentioned that 40 % of people worldwide travel to europe .
we do not think it is on .
what is a foodstuff which is substantially equivalent ?
we must give the courts the opportunity to do their work .
the german version reads : ' condemns the execution of the two tibetans and another nine uighurs ' .
you mentioned , very briefly i must say , the agricultural sector .
they are all tarred with the same dirty brush !
i find myself in concurrence with his view , both as to the importance of this issue and to the fact that we need to persevere .
i asked the commissioner a direct question .
the change taking place in arabia must be seized as an opportunity for peace between israel and palestine .
i want to pay particular tribute to mr galeote quecedo .
we have to address this issue .
it is therefore basic biological facts that form the basis of the proposed measures .
which path will havana choose ?
i believe that , if we do that , they will flourish far better and live far longer .
it must ensure that everything is addressed .
the important thing is whether we talk or whether we act .
my thanks go to all the political groups that have been with us throughout in a critical and constructive spirit .
in this respect , the role of advertising is ambivalent .
too many moments when something could have been done and it was not .
we spend 50 % of our lives in our homes .
the irish presidency faces formidable tasks , but it has been well prepared .
the sudanese government has shown no willingness to protect internally displaced persons .
. mr president , i am pleased that we are holding this debate today .
the following change has been proposed :
as the following questions deal with the same subject matter , they will be taken together :
here too , i know that you will say : ' but that is a form of income support ! '
we must reinvigorate our neighbourhood policy when it comes to countries such as egypt .
because when you look at humanity no two human beings are the same .
furthermore , by only targeting certain industries , we are not helping all pakistanis .
you said that will happen .
that is why i voted against amendments 8 and 9 .
i support the report and congratulate the rapporteur .
this parliament , i hope , will not approve a minimal reform .
– a house of european history ;
a more balanced report will then be submitted to plenary .
if other nations defend their farmers , why should n't europe defend its own farmers ?
i would also like to say a word about a group called youth with a mission .
it was the parliamentarians who made it !
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the problem is burden - sharing .
there can not be anything more important than this .
gsm and gps technology already exists , and gps2 is only around the corner .
i do not think that the davignon report assesses that correctly .
it is also clear that the community per se does not have community competence in criminal issues .
in my opinion , we need a greatly improved democratic method .
the ukrainian elections have taken place .
this is a case of double standards .
i think that is needed as a start to the healing process .
animals can be healthy even without these conditions , as we know from practical experience .
no recruitment will be taking place at all with this proposal for 2007 .
international roma day will be celebrated next friday , 8 april .
i appreciate the very broad support for this piece of legislation .
and what you do is to reward companies which never comply with legislation .
between 1991 and 1994 a special committee of inquiry investigated all the instances of embezzlement in that case .
when i looked at them i did not see any problem .
you have also said something very important : that europe is not in crisis .
therefore in the end i voted in favour .
this can be guaranteed by keeping research separate from execution .
being competitive does not mean yielding blindly to the pressures of globalisation .
the complicated background to the conflict shows the depth of the divisions involved .
that is something we would do very well .
madam president , once again everything seems to be conspiring towards helplessness .
i have had 26 speakers , which would work out at around 23 seconds per speaker .
it is , therefore , important that the commission has the support of parliament on this matter .
i remain convinced that nutrient profiles are a misguided concept .
the next item is the joint debate on :
which are the three policies that i feel are most to blame ?
the right to survival comes before all other rights .
we need someone who can put the ' european ' back into the european council .
i therefore ask that the debate be rescheduled for 20   april , the tuesday of the next part - session in strasbourg .
unfortunately , however , this does not surprise me .
i think it gives an extraordinarily poor impression of this parliament .
but for people to move around freely is not yet as easy as is sometimes suggested .
the process has taken too long .
it seems to me that it is important to emphasise this .
i would like to ask the president of the european central bank the following questions .
( fr ) where tallinn appears in the text , we would like ,
that is the measure of the problem .
he has humiliated them , because he has allowed killings , he has allowed rapes .
on 20 march , overnight , businesses which had thrived for many years were simply wiped out .
the baku - tbilisi - ceyhan oil pipeline is also not insignificant in this matter .
the banks will have to face up to their responsibility .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday .
in future we should not have to rely on the press for our information .
we had these meetings in new york exactly on this matter .
the decision relating to the re - admission agreement has just been signed today .
we need less price volatility and more transparency .
mr president , i have just three comments to make on this debate .
it was certainly a turning point .
recommendation for second reading of the langen report ( a5 - 16/99 )
within what timeframe , commissioner , will this crucial text be proposed ?
but it also includes training programmes for national administrations .
do statistics mean sovietisation to you ?
otherwise , the european code of conduct , no matter how well intended , is completely futile .
that concludes the debate .
i wonder who will give the money ?
nevertheless , this small light has been lit .
i believe we have achieved a good result .
we did make some progress during our negotiations with the council , but too little .
these repressive measures , which violate freedom of expression , are worrying and unacceptable .
the german government deserves our support for its commitment .
now , i recognise that we are in an increasingly complicated situation .
it is important here that we produce some guidelines for the future .
only in that way can the euro region continue to justify the trust placed in it .
the first , the employment report , is a commission report .
the irish lesson does not seem to have been understood .
are we to continue burning coal unchecked ?
in that respect the council followed parliament , which has to be recorded as a positive step .
it does not automatically mean that the new member states should , or will be able , to accede to the eu en bloc .
we can not accept this .
it was for these reasons that i voted in favour .
is this a one - off , or will there be further discussion ?
. madam president , i wish to thank the rapporteur for his work .
i therefore support the measures proposed .
the next item is question time ( b6 - 0384/2007 ) .
the next item is the continuation of the joint debate on agenda 2000 .
there are no good solutions , a fact that could be described as embarrassing .
here we must create real cooperation .
we have tried , in our resolution , to emphasise both these factors simultaneously .
i was recently in china , where , as we know , there are 20 billion head of poultry .
the voluntary nature of these donations and the fact that the donors receive no payment are regarded as self - evident .
that is what we do not like .
we take note of this comment .
i would like to stress one aspect of the first point .
what i mean is that forests have a multi - functional role .
the debate is closed .
of course , quite a few dossiers remain open .
we have no inferiority complex about that .
in other words , it is talking about pioneering technology rather than biotechnology .
and it seems to me - and to many other europeans - that this has been a wasted opportunity in that respect .
we must establish standard rules for all biofuels .
( the president cut off the speaker )
i attempted to contact an official .
i find that quite natural .
what is the marking exactly ?
recommendation for second reading ( a4 - 0038/98 ) hautala
in writing . - there are still too many unsafe products available on the market .
parliament decided to postpone the vote and the matter was deemed to have been referred back to committee
( parliament adopted the resolution )
andré - léonard recommendation ( a4 - 0071/99 )
that is part of the process of monitoring the degree to which any convergence takes place .
we would like to see restrictions on when national regulatory authorities can intervene .
it is undeniable that agricultural trade operates within the global trading system .
consequently , our markets are not being permanently flooded with these products .
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .
this can not surely be allowed .
we need to put an end to this kind of spin .
but i very much hope that we shall have a clear decision tomorrow .
written statements ( rule 142 )
i have been listening to the debate .
madam president , the presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
so that , even thousands of kilometres away , they hear our voice in luanda !
this is my interpretation of the outcome .
mr president , i think i can deal with this matter very briefly .
it had never been done before .
i will make four points .
even before his european presidency begins , his house of cards is collapsing .
we have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .
what happened on 15 november 1988 ?
we will therefore vote against the report .
what is going on in delhi ?
i was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the roma in europe .
mankind - you and i. who are we , you and i ?
the european union must introduce measures to support the creative sector .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i welcome your determination .
it is right to refine , reduce and replace animal testing wherever possible .
the result is a well - balanced report , which i support .
i suggest that only the dishonest ones stand to gain from this commission proposal .
it is my conviction that the european union lacks commitment in this area .
in my opinion , food security in the eu depends on food production in the eu .
an eu special envoy for tibet was able to assume important coordination roles .
as mrs thors said , the best supervisory body we have is publicity and transparency , of which we should have a great deal .
you win some , you lose some - that is normal .
i would like a clear answer as to who will be in charge of coordination .
thank you , mrs piha .
the important thing is how these are complied with in reality .
there is a need for further research into fas .
as mr florenz observed , they have to sign and ratify it .
on a smaller scale , this is what we call piracy .
2 . the escalation of violence in mexico
i also hope we can resolve our problem with the usa .
you may ask a question , but not reopen the debate .
this must have resulted in significant cuts to the resources for individual countries .
the second suggestion concerns the role of the european investment bank .
please let us learn from that .
the present interim government has no democratic basis .
in fact , we call on other powers to carry out this communication role for us .
in writing . i welcome this report in tackling the eu waste problem .
it only meets on parliamentary premises .
we can have a common approach to russia if we really want to .
on the contrary , a lot of semi - finished products are included .
the public record now shows my actual voting intention .
we can then build additional policies on to that .
i think that the greatest victories are those that are achieved gradually .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have two clear objectives .
the second question concerns waste .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the commission is actively promoting the summit ’s recommendations in this area .
it needs no more than a simple change to implement it .
tax competition is a jolly good thing .
this is one of those belgian jokes which is not funny .
there are no contradictions .
what we have at present is too ambitious .
the united kingdom government is asking for better spending , not more spending .
i said this in the committee . the committee still voted to discharge .
the green paper is a policy paper .
cultivation of peas is now in decline , however .
this is a true compromise .
the commission agrees with you , mrs baldi , about the very special importance of that region .
ethnic , religious , social and national differences play no role in sport .
in writing . - ( de ) the european council has a few things planned for the agenda of its meeting .
the situation is quite different when it comes to protecting nature and the countryside .
the first area is humanitarian aid .
this is very positive , because readmission also helps the european union .
mr president , i voted in favour of the report on microfinance facilities .
in our judgment they do live up to their responsibilities .
however , this is an issue that is being discussed at council level .
10 . community postal services ( vote )
the situation in the european union is not much better .
question no 11 by alexandros alavanos ( h-0163/99 )
it should remain an exception and not become the rule .
changing agricultural policy is perhaps one of the biggest tasks of this plenary session .
mr president , it is a real procedural motion this time .
to put it another way , are we heading towards an economic government or not ?
where demand for energy is concerned , there is considerable ground for us to make up .
there are indeed one or two aspects , and therefore i , too , am in favour of postponement .
madam president , we have rejected the report on the employment policy .
award of the sakharov prize to mr xanana gusmão
a slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake .
mr president , i am picking up where mrs rothe left off .
this reaction cast a more positive light on modern china .
i would like to return to the first question from mrs badia i cutchet .
we are running the risk of discrediting ourselves .
we are not neutral .
there is no uniform case law on this subject .
everyone is entitled to this .
the main priority of the european union is jobs .
we badly need them for all our futures .
( hu ) we will have to come to terms with oil prices remaining high in the long term .
but this means action on an international level as well as on a european union level .
hopefully , in november we may get something more positive .
the difference between forced prostitution and prostitution is very small .
also , we are only getting the german interpretation in our offices .
but what is the true face of iran ?
i should like to turn my attention to a few details in the list of priorities .
for these reasons we can not vote for the report .
in plenary session that represents a precedent .
it will then be possible to improve considerably european forms of governance .
it does not simply cover the port itself , but mainly the port users .
in its decision , the commission is , in actual fact , highlighting discrimination alone .
that was also the basis for the commission 's proposal .
the assertion that renewable energy could become more expensive is wrong .
in 2007 the level of eu aid decreased .
( fr ) madam president , you are absolutely right .
madam president , i would like to speak on the subject of togo .
i therefore believe that we need progress in this regard .
i strongly condemn such actions .
there is a ' pull ' effect in play .
the report makes various general recommendations , which i welcome .
is that the best we can expect in this area ?
but is concerns everybody .
finally , i ask the european parliament to show its colours .
we give two dollars a day to a cow .
for all these reasons , i shall be voting in favour of this motion for a resolution .
we do of course find that life expectancy has risen tremendously over the years .
it is a necessary condition , but in itself it is not enough .
mr president , our public pensions systems are too expensive and have also ceased to be financeable .
firstly there is the maintenance of the principle of relative stability .
what emerged from the efforts concerned , however ?
this is happening as we speak .
we are at the stage where regulation - and strong regulation at that - is required .
mr figel’ , you have the floor again .
it is true that the short - term outlook is good due to the economy picking up .
you will have read how we intend to do this in our programme for the presidency .
last sunday , thanks to " the blues " , france became champions of europe .
however , as the directive now includes old plants , i shall vote for the compromise as well .
we have to bring them together and create a synthesis right across the eu .
why is the problem of safety being raised ?
let us hope , however , that the postal services people will soon be up and about .
colleagues , do you not think our voters have noticed ?
we also wish to have a solid basis for cooperation with the ngos .
we share your view on this point too .
that is why we are also complying with the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations .
for me , there are three essential tasks .
questions to mrs reding
the situation is , indeed , dramatic .
if not , there is something wrong with integration .
under no circumstances are women ’s rights a secondary consideration .
this package contains very up - to - date and progressive proposals .
they have been set up in those regions where the approach is most advanced .
real help comes only with understanding , and understanding comes only with clarity .
i remember that the commissioner shared our view .
to restate , in view of the forthcoming wto summit , the position of the european union .
this house ’s position is clear . we are not just drawing up a resolution .
here , on this aspect , i do not believe that we can demand too much from the commission .
dear colleagues , these discussions last from 15.00 to 20.00 , which is five hours .
the aim of full employment and economic growth must apply in particular to the current objective 1 regions . that is where growth is slowest and unemployment highest , commissioner .
composition of parliament : see minutes
we have to avoid that at all costs , if at all possible .
zimbabwe remains a thorny issue .
in times of crisis , undertakings come under increasing pressure .
but , of course , they can not , because these proceedings are held in secret .
decision on urgent procedure
some of the issues raised are much more complex , and merit careful consideration .
they look good in themselves . i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
mr president , thank you for your remarks concerning mr wei jingsheng .
first , let us look at the brighter side .
it leaves it clear to anybody reading the text what the appropriate procedure is that will govern this particular situation .
also , those who address it in that way do not give full justice to the seriousness of the problem .
that may well be one way of resolving the issue .
the council 's budget proposal is a frugal one .
i ask the house for its support by voting in favour of this report .
and that is a great responsibility , since the future of europe is at stake .
commemoration of the tragedy in the united states on 11 september 2001
the commission is looking at the situation in europe and elsewhere .
in any case , he was here for the commentary .
it must not be forgotten that over 200 million people still live in poverty there .
someone has known about the scandal for a very long time , and someone has wished to conceal it .
my group is able to support all the amendments .
in that respect , all credit to the rapporteur .
could the president - in - office be more specific on the question of economic sanctions .
this is purely related to the funding of it .
i think they have got this wrong .
the second principle is that of mission speciality .
closing down a political party is not , and can not be , business as usual .
i should like to remind the commission of our firm pledge to achieve 20 % .
please try to understand that .
but we must make swift decisions .
the eu must be proactive and not simply place the responsibility on croatia .
for this reason , i have voted against this report .
written statements ( rule 142 )
in addition to this there is climate change and desertification .
nothing else will satisfy us .
mrs ayala referred to that .
we should also consider policy actions in yemen and bahrain .
the year 2020 will then be taken as a benchmark .
however , at the moment , this agreement is not yet completely signed and sealed .
with all respect for you and your office , i have a request to make .
perhaps the reason you are complaining today is because you were not invited .
you must take the appropriate measures and also demand that the council do so .
is it in progress ?
the rapporteur has introduced notable improvements to the commission proposal .
immigration policy , though , must go hand in hand with a policy for integration .
even now the hotels are struggling to cope .
we can also expect progress in relation to industrial tariffs in the months to come .
the tax on financial transactions and eurobonds should therefore be the cornerstone .
but let me clarify the commission 's point of view again .
at the same time , however , we also wish to give active support to positive trends .
3 . personal data protection in the european union (
we are not questioning the content of such a charter .
in my opinion , digital has already won .
is this where we want to end up ?
so let us use common sense .
and i , together with the thousand italians , saw these settlements expanding all over the place .
i am against it because there are better uses for this level of public expense .
i sometimes wonder if we speak to the same people .
i was very glad to hear what you said about tariff escalation .
composition of committees and delegations : see minutes
you have serious dioxin emissions .
it should be seen only as the supplement .
i believe that the european union must do likewise .
that would entirely remove the basis for the intergovernmental nature of the treaty .
written statements ( rule 149 )
the international election observers criticised the moldovan authorities in this respect .
not everything will be plain sailing .
will this at least increase the level of requirements and quality for all member states ?
mr president , we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms .
i would like just to refer to three broad groups of issues .
however , there are several areas that still need improvement .
so there is much to be done .
question no 42 by christine oddy ( h-0211/99 )
it will bring further humanitarian benefits to the iraqi people .
this means that four of the nine states with baltic coastlines are now members of the union .
but you know as well as i that the union is progressing slowly .
i may well have upset him : if so , i apologize .
in the text of the resolution , reference was made to this state .
another important point is the principle of regionalisation .
this is not a criticism .
in those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable .
the ability to be democratic goes hand in hand with the ability to discuss .
for all these reasons , the euro is a powerful factor in our integration .
this authority is primarily concerned with food safety .
i shall conclude by saying a few words about the work to be done .
i would therefore appeal to the house 's sense of collective responsibility .
that was the decision of the commission today .
it still is , so we therefore have this sectoral approach .
there is a very long list of requests .
madam president , saddam hussein has inflicted vast suffering on huge numbers of people .
my understanding was that there is now a pact on the matter .
key activity 2 : foreign languages .
in addition , it is necessary for those parties to be independent .
it is therefore taking its time .
let us learn from the past and consider other alternatives for the future .
we need to do more if women are to be enabled to escape from forced prostitution .
i fail to understand the point of all the discussion here .
redundancies are becoming increasingly common .
now for the misgivings , which are as follows .
since we have changed the legal basis , we need the new text .
this statement by the commission was long overdue .
is it permissible to use them for research purposes ?
( de ) madam president , mr schulz is right .
we must not handicap ourselves from the outset .
let us hope that this human rights defender is exaggerating .
i am very happy about this .
tell mr steinbrück that things can not go on the way they are !
i am grateful to both commissioners for mentioning the issue of poverty . i believe that the struggle on behalf of the roma is , above all , a struggle against poverty and not only amongst the roma .
around 75 % of our plant protein is imported .
it is essential that these efforts should complement each other .
for all these reasons we must vote for this report .
the second guideline action concerns development policies .
there are a few points that i would like to emphasise .
mr president , it has not been an easy task for the belgian presidency .
this was my fourth intergovernmental conference .
a compromise depends , however , upon both give and take by the parties concerned .
but the jobs will be lost here .
let us stop dreaming and look at the reality .
will it be less or will it be more ?
question no 6 by karl habsburg - lothringen ( h-0873/97 )
there is a lack of coordination in this area .
the president - in - office has a tremendous challenge ahead of him .
i have no view , then , as to whether there is bias in one direction or the other .
it was right to do so .
why is the commission not proposing similar terms in the case of avian influenza ?
the court 's 18 judges will be sworn in and the court will be inaugurated today .
it is playing with fire to behave like this in times of such uncertainty .
over the weeks that follow , many thule workers were involved in the clear - up .
however , we can not do that today as we have to vote on the report .
the most important thing , though , is that this is how we are approaching this matter , and that is very valuable .
could you update us on the progress there ?
democracy , subsidiarity and civil courage work . ”
do not leave it until the end of the year .
the council , which is not here of course , should understand that .
when you end that count , 80 people in the world will have died of starvation .
i declare an interest in the equestrian area .
a body like the human rights council exists only in principle .
the president of the commission has given fulsome answers on wikileaks .
all this will not be accomplished as soon as tomorrow morning .
this also applies to parliament .
this is less than two years ago .
i think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play .
all the member states of the eu are now involved in projects in one way or another .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
workers and the intelligentsia rebelled in the cause of freedom , social justice and dignity .
this has proved effective in new zealand and australia .
the international community is involved , albeit on a small scale .
situations of loss of income are on the increase and women are getting poorer .
( parliament gave its assent )
we must not accept this closure .
they do not have the same nautical qualities .
we need confidence - building measures , too .
what will all this mean to our citizens ?
let me finish with this : when war begins , politicians have failed .
the country is one great pile of bricks .
however , the major concern is what is being done about industrial pollution .
i would again thank mrs sörensen and all our colleagues .
voting will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( the sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
thirdly , there should be adequate funds allocated for this purpose .
left and right is only one dimension in politics .
today 's sitting lasts until 8 p.m. and we can not simply go on beyond then .
we take them seriously in parliament .
the debate is closed .
arms exports are killing people all over the world .
incidentally , in belgium , we are all too familiar with this .
that is the great european project that brings us together across party boundaries .
the debate is closed .
yet again , unfortunately , the european parliament has been used as a sounding board for national issues .
but what have we seen ?
we are fully aware of moldova 's european aspirations .
so i will stay with this position .
27 . crisis of the equitable life assurance society ( vote )
however , this is something that will probably be a feature of our work in the coming years .
everything that can be done must be done to alleviate this human suffering .
only 7 % have begun preparations .
it is my opinion that the research committee 's resolution conceals the same danger .
the commitments still outstanding are not to be equated with late payment .
the existing patent laws are adequate .
independent investigations must be carried out to bring the guilty to justice .
unfortunately , some member states are high on rhetoric and low on action .
i do not mind where we meet the envoys .
they want support for fair trade products and for free trade unions .
business registers for statistical purposes ( debate )
that is why both sides now need a viable strategy .
section v , court of auditors
we are all in his debt and his reward has been the favourable vote in the committee on foreign affairs .
cotton and tobacco in greece have been secured in warehouses .
thirteen years later , the results are not impressive .
it is obvious that the council needs to make improvements here .
secondly , i think we can calm down and make progress .
we hope that your visit will be fruitful and beneficial .
nothing could be further from the truth .
the same region nevertheless holds many great opportunities .
question no 51 by ( h-0647/00 ) :
welcome thus to this ' barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ' .
i have two concrete questions .
- before the vote on paragraph 13 :
mr president , i reject this report and i reject the treaty that it supports .
but you underestimated the prior work that had been done by some people .
the aims of the stockholm programme and its implementation plan are positive .
if that happens then i have no doubt that we will achieve a good result .
for this we need an industrial policy to be adopted .
it is certainly not as good as it ought to be .
the oslo spirit is dead .
the urban environment is something akin to a biosphere for the vast majority of european citizens .
the commission ' s view was a three - stage plan of operation .
specifically , this meant several budget cuts in 2008 and 2009 .
for them climate change is not a priority .
making changes to the guidelines at this stage could disrupt the process .
i propose that the nasdaq model should be used to achieve this .
they too will have to tell us how we are to handle it and how we are to pay for it .
some countries work with very many ngos , others with very few .
the eu must in this case prove its qualifications in the diplomatic sphere .
the opt - out makes no contribution to a social europe .
there can be no revival of europe without [ ... ] a spiritually great germany’ .
the information society
opening of the sitting
we can also show solidarity by showing financial solidarity .
the report which finally emerged goes some way to addressing these issues .
i therefore voted in favour of the motion .
one employment summit after another has failed .
this orderly procedure sends out the right signals to the public .
consequently , due to the subsidiarity principle , i voted against .
the importance of the social dimension was therefore highlighted in the clearest terms .
what is needed is a contribution of 0.7 % of the gnp of the member states .
that is a task for your presidency .
we have two options .
following a lengthy stay abroad , mr trinh had made investments in his own country .
it is they who would have to pay the price for the centralised regulation proposed by the commission .
is president lukashenko 's arrival in accordance with the values that we stand for ?
mr linkohr deserves praise for his report on the energy dimension of climatic change .
the debate is closed .
everyone has made mistakes .
i hope that the same thing will happen in tomorrow 's vote .
i have three proposals and i should like , most emphatically , to ask for their support .
there are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .
men and women , elderly people and children .
let us start by looking at how the common positions deal with this issue .
that is my firm conviction .
it is not only oil spills we are talking about .
i am saddened that i stand here tonight and we do not have a resolution .
that means complete freedom for everyone to use 5 % alternative fats .
inevitably , what we are doing here is setting today 's technology in stone .
we need to go further .
there must be an end to all economic blockades .
i do not exaggerate .
all of these are in short supply .
did they not know that only a bloodbath could only ever ensue as a result ?
the total funding has been more than eur 18 million .
so let there be no misunderstandings on that front .
everyone is talking - and mostly about ideas - but we only listen to what we ourselves are saying .
it encourages albania to continue to make improvements in this area .
member states must lift obstructions .
therefore it will not be possible to channel sufficient funds to regions or countries with economic crises .
( the sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m. )
mr president , there is an air of unreality about much of this debate .
clearly elections are something of untold value , and that is why they also need monitoring .
i would like the council to pay due attention to those two conditions .
in german , however , this expression has unfortunate overtones , although as far as content is concerned it means something similar .
we all want to grow old , but we would prefer not to be old .
i think it is the interests of both .
my compliments to mrs saïfi .
that was evident at the summit .
second , a hysterical obsession with man - made global warming .
i would like to make two points in this respect .
the recognition of the right of association is in line with that argument and should serve as a basis for it .
outcome of the copenhagen summit on climate change ( debate )
thus , the 7th directive should be extended .
it is a question of maintaining equilibrium between copyright and the rights of consumers .
there is a commission initiative . what is the aim ?
i believe that this is the council 's position on this issue .
you have often said this .
i have no problem with that .
this means that we can not support the report .
not for thirty years has their purchasing power been so low .
that is the truth of the situation we face .
the debate is closed .
we in the green group see eastward enlargement as the current political goal of the european union .
the united states does not make this choice .
it was clear that the people of sudan faced major problems and need support .
we should be alert to situations which may arise tomorrow or the day after .
what consistency is there at the heart of this policy followed by the commission ?
mr president , i would like to thank mrs langenhagen for her report .
also , the exchange rate of the dollar against the zloty no longer supports the argument about illegal work .
parliament ' s report will provide important input .
the space sector to a large extent represents one of the frontiers of pioneering technology .
that is a request that we have made .
it was at around midnight that i got to my hotel , where i was dealt with more efficiently .
this is a real challenge for the commission .
the power of codecision proved to be decisive .
i thank the commissioner for his reply .
what we are embarking on now is a gigantic undertaking .
i hope that this is noted before we hold the final vote .
the solutions proposed by the turkish government are not satisfactory .
i give the floor to mr liikanen to answer mr kristoffersen 's question .
next : who is responsible ?
it is of utmost importance for our parliament to be totally involved .
not a moment before , however .
i shall start with a simple , important point concerning enlargement .
no binding commitments emerged .
we need to bring an end , not only to poverty , but also to dependence .
the dover tragedy happened between two european countries .
whether the threshold is 1 % or 0.5 % , if practicable , these are a step forward .
it coordinates the criminal prosecution authorities in the fight against organised crime .
thank you very much , mr posselt .
neither will be accepted in any case .
let me now comment on the proposed co2 regulation that is currently on the table .
i should like to ask the council to take account of these in its considerations .
i do not think the council has been particularly active in the past .
i hope that we will , together , succeed in this .
bargaining over aims and goals in all matters we shall leave for seattle .
other vital topics include transport , energy , and the environment .
the report allows for no staggering in this area .
the commission likes to present itself as the 28th donor .
it was the costa neves report .
the member states will play a full role through the continuum of the advisory forum .
– this is not a question , commissioner .
could we be opposed in this house to decolonisation ?
i would like to press the commissioner further .
mr president , i refer to page 31 of yesterday 's minutes - the fontaine report .
that is not changed by this directive .
we are now securing the funding for the decisions which were adopted back in december .
we need to reprioritise and redistribute funds within the eu budget .
the interinstitutional dialogue must therefore be strengthened .
it must be said that , in terms of its actual content , this proposal makes no sense .
i screamed and called for help and chased the perpetrators as far as the park .
mombaur report ( a5 - 0180/2000 )
it is something we should value .
this also needs to be a focus within the european council .
twenty million hectares of tropical forests are either seriously affected or else totally destroyed .
the proposal is thus to refer this report back to committee without debate .
however , we should wait until the commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money .
what we can infer for sure is that it will only increase the work for some patent lawyers .
we have this at local , national and european level .
therefore , the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts .
in montreal we had a big achievement in the montreal action plan .
the rapporteur is aware of this , as we have discussed it together .
while the seats remain as they are in the present hemicycle , those who arrive first will enjoy that privilege .
in the future , these programmes should receive greater financial support .
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
so these are not people on the breadline , these are not poor people .
just how serious the reaping in europe is going to be remains to be seen .
the plenary is not the right place for that , however .
finally , i would like to emphasise the importance of working with ngos .
we also have an open mind about international regulations .
the fund is too small to achieve anything .
furthermore , i think that mr maaten and the commission on the environment , public health and consumer policy have produced a good piece of work .
madam president , we have to look to the future .
let us tell the truth , please .
madam president , i want to concentrate on fair trade bananas .
i particularly wanted to mention that .
preventing a problem is better than going the long way of legal redress .
paedophilia on the internet must be prosecuted .
and what about the working groups : will the names of all the experts be given ?
i also do not support your proposals for measures which are incompatible with the particular groups .
as far as consolidation is concerned , work is progressing fairly well .
i would now like to look more specifically at three points .
as for the united kingdom , you know all about us .
mr president , commissioner , i am pleased that we are having this debate .
it is regression not progress : that is an issue of substance .
this is what amnesty says .
without this fundamental clarification , no partial proposal will have any effect .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
if there are no objections , we shall proceed as suggested .
decision on urgent procedure
on 1 january of this year it was enlarged to include slovenia .
no real assessments have been carried out in this area .
we are not starting from scratch here .
in this respect , europe will have to seek acceptance .
i very much echo what mrs buitenweg has said .
mrs kauppi and mrs starkevičiūtgave a report on this topic .
a land - based alternative must be thoroughly investigated instead .
let us reassert these words .
scientific findings on the ' greenhouse effect ' have been available for more than 180 years .
then it will automatically be up to the commission to introduce the final , decisive measures .
in practice , it does no such thing for there is a double lock on article k9 .
i can endorse the proposal adopted by the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
it is reminiscent of orwell ' s animal farm , where some are more equal than others .
so new complications can still develop in this situation .
we want a union that is more democratic , more accountable , more transparent and more effective .
according to the treaty , the european union is a union of independent states .
obviously , we have to work in cooperation with the unhcr , as in the kosovo situation .
the situation for contract agents is different .
i hope that you will take the same view today , commissioner .
this means that a very strong emphasis has been placed on the civilian side of things .

the second of these indications – and one to which reference has already been made – is that international law is being applied .

statement by the president

the debate is closed .
let me mention only ' amber fox ' as a key example .

it is competition that decides , and the public that benefits .
it is unfortunate , but we can not say that that is not true for europe .
second , offers in terms of financing .
mrs lulling , never before have european statistics been presented so elegantly in this house !
after all , what has now been adopted in this compromise does not by any means present a solution .
we think that this cooperation can be very fruitful .
otherwise , we will overstretch the precautionary principle here .
the commission will , of course , make any further news on this matter public as soon as possible .
a roof of this kind would inevitably tumble down .
this is crucial if we are to be efficient and make savings .
the austrian model is certainly quite interesting .
working closely with parliament , we have all been equal to the challenges .

our group fully agrees with this .
i now turn to the weber report .
mr   dos   santos and mr   markov mentioned the outstanding commitments .

this was the main objective of liberalisation .
how can we ensure that we get a consensus that it is a fair and equitable distribution ?
the assessment meeting presents a good opportunity to achieve this .
even in future , the ecb must not permit its own conduct to give rise to moral hazards !
mr burg , you have the floor .
many ideas have emerged regarding what we should spend it on .
why did the commission echo the hurried information from germany ?
so this is a good start .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
in my opinion it did not work ; it was not successful .
in parliament majorities are needed .
it is making a mockery of all democratic standards .
it is also a part of the internal market .
critical to our future action is the importance of globalisation .
in that first meeting the situation in east timor will be on the agenda .
i see that the irish bench is waking up .
we will have to negotiate with the council on this proposal .
yet it is now time for the celebrations to end and the hard work to begin .

environmental protection also creates growth and stability .
it is clear that solvit 's efficiency needs to be further increased .
therefore , this report is irrelevant !
in november , the council adopted an arms embargo and other restrictive sanctions .
i know all the arguments that it has been tried before without results .
it happens every single time .
the resolution has no formal effect at all , but is merely an expression of how parliament feels .
this is the basis of my own viewpoint here .
are you not going to do something for pensioners as well ?
do you understand , though , mr antunes ?
we also need more power at our disposal throughout this process .
i would like to mention a case in belgium , since obviously this is where i work .

this unilateral behaviour is unacceptable to us .
subsequently , it is important to help women suffering from the disease .
i also sense a certain frustration in here about the timetable now .

as far as the common fisheries policy is concerned we are on the road to nowhere .
we should actually be welcoming immigrants , people who are trying to improve their lot .
it took three whole months for the council to enter into negotiations .
having taken that into account , we have to take our responsibilities and decide who has to deal with this . that is the situation today .
( the president cut off the speaker )
strictly speaking , however , they should be here for their name to be read out .
the wise approach would be not to allow glass bottles in the passenger cabin .
i must admit that i completely forgot about this formal sitting .

you have all heard this , you heard it just now .
europe needs a common immigration policy .
simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed .
any person expressing approval or disapproval shall immediately be ejected by the ushers . '
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
there are national parliaments for that .
i hope that other industrialised countries will also follow the eu 's example .
it is a good thing that the council has the power in military matters , and that there has to be unanimity .
that concludes voting time .
the vote will take place at 12:00 tomorrow , thursday , 17 february .

now , good as the explanatory statement is , it does not say it all .
every group in this house was represented on that working group .
such measures must be compatible with this treaty .
however , i have not heard much about any of this yet today .
this means talking about everything , in other words , putting forward a very wide - ranging proposal .
with these remarks i wish to express my support for the draftsman ’s proposal .
as they deal with the same subject , questions nos 1 , 2 and 3 will be taken together .
the commission would help tremendously if we could get some clarification on that .
you mentioned the financial perspective .
the current system does not work .
so things have come full circle .
that is the reality of the situation .
let me come to calmer matters .
the debate is closed .

hence our vote in favour of the report .

now , the age of knowledge - based economies is opening up .
relating to amendment no 3
i look forward to welcoming him soon in his new portfolio .

until then , we shall remain slightly below the 25 billion that is required .
we are concerned about a possible new conflict between azerbaijan and armenia .
this is a naïve and dangerous assumption .
mr president , i would like to speak principally on the report by mr cunha .
the problems in the border area can not be insoluble .
we support him in that .
i think that answers mr   gahler ’s suggestion .
i think that we have set up a marvellous programme .
the directive must not be allowed to endanger this work .
we live in a time of enormous challenges .
i do not understand why the commission is playing into the hands of the member states .

more must be done in relation to this in future .
is that a successful policy ?
member states have contributed the largest share of the military force in lebanon .
greater flexibility in the second pillar ;
you will see in item 7 that i have been named as mr rather than mrs mcnally .
do you not know the conditions under which charter flights operate ?
they know too that progress must be made in this matter .
parliament will therefore , of course , apply pressure in this area .
if i may , i should now like to make some brief comments on the issues that we discussed .
that means a loss of prosperity , a loss of real wages , a loss of purchasing power .
but trade policy is about more than just competitiveness and growth .
i hope you will bear that in mind when it comes to the vote .
in my view , it could have been much better .
no true european ...

i shall await the commission 's proposals on this matter .
mrs ludford , are you sure your point of order is related to the minutes ?
to be honest , it is not very reassuring .
unfortunately the crimes are continuing , with two differences .
i am not going to mention them one by one , as this is not my intention .
fifteen of them were the right way up but the union flag was upside - down .
the objective is positive .
however , next time , i would request that you do not exceed your speaking time by 100 % !

unfortunately , these are the only means at our disposal .
the irish situation is an excellent case study in point .
mr   president , i should like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
the rule in our speeches is to try to make a contribution to the reports .
that is something we must consider when we take measures to combat the problems caused by noise .
the group of the greens has tabled amendments to this effect , which i should like to endorse .
secondly , i think we must be logical in the order in which agreements are reached here in the house .
there is the question raised by mr cornelissen relating to the dredging industry .
quite exceptionally , the rapporteur is asking for the floor again .
thank you for your comment , ms thors .
open coordination - it sounds like a really modern logo .
however , the assignment and training of personnel will inevitably take time .
bureaucracy has become so complicated that it stifles volunteers ' enthusiasm .
many young seals are at present aborted in the water .
( the president put the proposal to the house which decided to end voting time )

the form and content of the text must be of a high quality .
instead , a qualified majority of member states is to be sufficient .
mr siniora is a dignified man , a man we should respect .
they are unable to benefit from erdf support .
it follows that the european system can not be that bad !
finally , a wish and , in any case , a will .

in writing . - we had to abstain at the end .
we want the use of phthalates to be monitored and preferably reduced .
parliament will be devoting particular attention to this issue .
mr president , i should like to make four points .
it goes without saying that closer ties with the european union are a desirable objective .
but convergence seems to have become a real ideology in brussels .
this is where the european union 's place and role lies .
restarting it promptly is in the interests of all parts of the world .
on the one hand , it refuses to raise the financial ceiling for category 4 and this is only right .
the commission is willing to take another look at the issue .
they come to their own individual solutions , and in that we must not interfere .
in any case , the objective is more recycling and greater re - use .
both these exceptions are positive .
findings have progressed greatly worldwide .
do we want to deliver the final blow to the european textiles sector ?
not having it would be a problem for the future of europe and for our ambitions .

we need to come together with a clear offer of massive international assistance .
our committee is committed to taking forward the lisbon process .

i would ask you again to agree to do that .
( the president asked the speaker to continue )
our committee is anxious to ensure that the energy will be used efficiently .
we are on the right track with this proposal from mr evans .

the protection of national constitutions must be given precedence and guaranteed .
unfortunately , i do not have time to discuss this .
i would like to thank parliament for supporting us on this policy .
important decisions were taken concerning the control of mass immigration .
no decision on it has as yet been reached .
that has been proven economically , financially and empirically .
in an open economy , however , vacant posts are immediately occupied .
i give mrs aelvoet the floor to move the request .
i hope that the new rapex china system will help remedy this .
this is the constructive message that i wished to convey to you today on behalf of my group .
the debate is closed .
until now , they applied only to non - dangerous waste .
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
and we have to investigate the deep - seated reasons for this scourge in order to attempt to find an effective cure for the problem .
i think we need to learn some of the lessons from the past industrial revolutions .
we must ensure that this does not turn into a disastrous trend for certain regions .
what else do you want to know ?
i believe that approach to be flawed .
before the vote on paragraph 13 :
unfortunately , when this text was being transcribed , part of a sentence was missed out .
thank you , commissioner flynn .
the report recommends that the peat industry should be included in this cluster .
in the current situation , you have a duty to take the initiative in this area .
the first large group of issues concerns the area of security , freedom and justice .
important and right though that is , it costs money .
i abstained from voting on this report .
the latter is available exclusively for the funding of local development projects .
adoption of binding targets for 2020 is difficult for many member states .
previous speakers have described this , and i wish to touch on it only very briefly .
i have one comment to make .
i am not going to sum up all my recommendations here .
as a doctor , i strongly support this .
the other member states were and continue to be excluded from these waters .
there is a significant difference between the two amendments , however .
only with the constitution will europe be equal to its global responsibilities .
that protection is something of which we should be proud .
the united states turned them away .
i should also like to say how grateful we are to you , commissioner .
i have a horrible feeling that the whole ship is sinking .
membership of committees and delegations : see minutes
the debate is closed .
the cooperation was quite constructive and the results are , above all , significant .
debt service payments often exceed health and education budgets .
thirdly , the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up .
commissioner , i would like to thank you very much indeed .
i have to say that i regard this opting - out arrangement as absolutely absurd .
it is in fact a very special activity .
in any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .
question no 17 by brian crowley ( h-1215/98 ) subject : the fight against organised crime
the example of georgia shows that such reforms have already brought results .
these are huge tasks requiring amounts far greater than those initially planned .
the vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
during the previous five years the budgetary framework had been eur 125 million per year .
however , we need to do more .
nonetheless , together with the council , we have to take account of the finance ministers .
we very much appreciate that .
i do not know how we are to approach the matter legally .
the parliamentary reports are available and i am very keen to know what the council will make of them .
there are two points i should like to single out from what the council presidency said .
that is not at all normal .
the entire european parliament has worked on the seventh framework programme .
it is also apparent that our meetings will show greater transparency in future , and i have great hopes of that .
firstly , free market principles must continue to be upheld .
in my view , the accident in japan demonstrated , first of all , that nuclear energy is not safe .
( hu ) madam president , in europe , cultural diversity is a value which all of us must take action to defend .
new technology is developing rapidly in aviation .
it may be a great european loan .
good examples include austria , belgium and france .
mr president , i congratulate mr peter on his report , which is of a very high quality .
this is tragic evidence of a security situation which is rapidly deteriorating .
that is an example of a mercenary force which is being sent out there , is n't it ?
and in politics , false realities produce false results .
human rights watch does not think so .
the treaty stipulates , among other things , that reasonable prices must be ensured .
it is not possible to comment further on these ongoing investigations .
unfortunately , the tunisian authorities remain reticent over the issue of this league .
we did not want to go beyond the treaty in any way .
there were many discussions over many years .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
a debate on what constitutes europe could provide both direction and clarity in this area .
the reality is that we can not do it even if we would like to .
this must never happen again .
but i will touch on some of the areas .
the plant is not yet there .
an announcement like the one levi strauss made last week is always regrettable .
without bees , many crops would fail .
at the end of the conference of presidents ' meeting yesterday , i spoke with mr rømer and other officials .
there is another reason .
the taoiseach owes it to his colleagues to present matters to them in a very direct manner .
does anyone wish to speak against it ?
equal opportunity policy is not something one can back out of .
in eight days ' time , the olympic games will be opening in sydney .
the use of logistics is , of course , a primary task of the enterprises .
i trust that is crystal clear .
the treaty is clear .
so i think that the prolongation of the time period is the correct decision for many reasons .
it is a dangerous strait - jacket .
we can negotiate two things :
yes , europe suffers from internal contradictions .
it must be done as a single unit and this must be discussed .
i would like to ask what the evaluation of those decisions looks like today .
however , the question , of course , is how long that will last .
what actually concerns our fellow citizens is the slowdown in the economy .
i accept that the eu is the world 's largest donor of development aid .
in some places thousands of televisions or digiboxes may have to be replaced .
we do not want to create illusions .
the debate is closed .
i would not like you to think , however , that our draft budget is bad .
the truth is that behind these debates lies a huge amount of waste .
let us not forget that foot and mouth disease is no respecter of borders .
what i heard seemed to be open to interpretation , and a few explanatory words would be welcome .
but we should consider what we can do better .
it is cultural .
so this is not a principle of subsidiarity , but the opposite .
i shall now try to perform my duties .
that is what i have to say on the subject of ' organized crime ' and ' demagogy ' .
one - minute speeches on matters of political importance
ireland has great confidence in the work for peace .
the next item is certainly also tremendously important and topical .
it is precarious because we depend on supplies of oil from unstable parts of the world .
the increase in support for structural funds alone cost around an extra sek 250 million .
thirdly , we have to be able to cope financially .
the fact that this code of conduct is not legally binding is a disgrace .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
the final recommendation was to restrict the number of formations of the council .
it is important that that should be said .
there may be agreement on hebron , but new obstacles have now emerged .
therefore , the summit in madrid on wednesday is of particular importance .
the resolution is clear .
this , of course , is directed at commissioner pascal lamy .
these concerns include the following :
the costs of purchasing fish quotas are of the order of ecu 300 million .
it is not a preselection for transition to the euro .
i rather doubt that we have achieved that .
there is no possibility of drawing up a definitive and inclusive list of its operatives .
we need flexibility in all this .
the vote will take place on thursday 4 september .
there can not be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries .
so far this year , over 200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed by fire in the european union .
nor does the commission mention it in its proposals .
the illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business .
we could carry on this way , but we would be wasting time .
however , i do have a few comments to make .
there are four points i would make here .
it is not clear from the report why the commission and parliament should take this on .
nowadays 80 % of eu citizens live in cities and the majority of business is conducted there too .
in other words , it accepts that its reform will have damaging consequences .
subject : military budget for athena financing mechanism
this area , however , is strictly a competence of the member states .
we expect your guidance on this major issue , baroness ashton .
clearly , they underestimate this fundamental instrument of democracy .
public administration plays a key role in the process of migrating to sepa .
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .
how does the commission feel about this idea ?
mr president , of course it has everything to do with the patenting directive .
i am going to speak to vice - president suleiman as soon as i leave the chamber .
i would think that that will give people much more hope .
there must be clear requirements for following up the results .
the artificial , fast - track breeding of chicks and turkeys must be discontinued .
i take note of that . i will try to follow it up , as requested .
that would be inconsistent in the light of our criticism .
large areas are being devastated today and we all know what that means for the climate .
it is important that we continue to support that .
these funds were in addition to the aid provided by the national programmes .
finally , i would like to make it quite clear once again that we want to give you our full support .
it is important , though , to get this balance right .
gaining acceptance of eu cooperation will certainly take some doing .
the eu has a responsibility to see that its citizens are well informed .
and , mr president , i wanted to finish by saying that :
these are the voices we must listen to .
now they will be working with us for peace , prosperity , stability and freedom .
instead of the 832 000 voters per mep to date , there will now be 858 000 .
affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure .
instead there is continuing violence .
we think this growing mass of eu authorities merely creates bureaucracy .
we can not do so while anarchy is permitted to rule in any state of the union .
personally , i am not going to say yes to agenda 2000 .
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
i represent the people .
it is at a grass roots level that problems will be solved , not in brussels .
i will end here .
the commission has already agreed to extend the period from 3 to 5 years .
and europe never spoke up at times like that .
what position will you adopt in relation to third countries ?
( pl ) the mentality of the turks has changed little since the times of kemal atatürk .
i am rather philosophical here on the principle of better late than never .
we can not , however , accept amendments nos 1 to 7 , 9 , 15 , 17 , 18 and 21 .
the commission wanted eur 1.5 billion for a five - year period .
this is in the interests of farming and therefore of farmers .
this is another area of grave concern .
when you are trying to pull together a negotiating position , lots of things are said .
the low breeding rate of the kittiwake that mr busk referred to is of particular concern .
in short , this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen jews from shiraz .
against this backdrop , the report highlighted three key points .
it allows those involved in flying for pleasure to be exempt from insurance cover for war and terrorism .
firstly , i would mention the importance of european research .
enlargement is the political expression of reconciliation in europe . that is our great opportunity .
as for the elections in israel , i perceive them to be more of a cause for concern than a source of hope .
there are , however , some shortcomings , especially in the field of democratic control .
afghanistan : one year after the bonn agreement
( the president cut the speaker off )
these are issues that touch all of us and my group therefore supports it .
the commission ' s white paper is a good point of departure for continued work on the strategy .
to put it more simply , these bodies must be independent and they must operate transparently .
we must end this inequality once and for all .
he turned the disarmament pledge into a farce .
the eu can not permit that .
we have also agreed about other issues , a fact i think we can be proud of .
hopefully this summit will change things .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
we all have many friends in israel who agree on this point .
still , this is not enough .
subject : framework directive on minimum income in the eu
in some member states , it is currently possible to buy one gigabyte for less than eur 1 . i have just looked at my mobile phone to see how much it costs me .
it might not even be that small a benefit ; it might actually be quite considerable .
a top - down and bottom - up approach have to meet each other .
( hu ) thank you for the floor , madam president .
commissioner , do you know what market demand is today ?
11 . green paper on better ship dismantling (
for all these reasons , the council and the commission must be excessively vigilant with regard to allocating aid .
investing in educational and cultural programmes ...
that is not the case at the moment .
it is a matter which also includes the structural fund .
there are a great many ways in which money could be saved in the eu .
after decades of discrimination and denial of rights , who is accusing who ?
they are well deserved .
the commission has based itself on already accepted international standards .
( the sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. )
that is clear .
we shall therefore be voting against these parts of the report .
we well know , and this must be said , what we should leave well alone .
that is good news , and is also largely thanks to you .
the 23 languages of the eu are what make us rich and diverse .
as far as we are concerned , this is a policy of de facto genocide .
a few weeks ago , we celebrated the first ten years of the european ombudsman .
municipalities and consumers would save on costs .
that decision was based only partially on real changes , for example in the constitution .
thank you for your attention , ladies and gentlemen .
the same should apply to sanctions imposed on member states .
he is a member of this house for whom i have great respect despite our political differences .
europe 's industries must seek niche markets in good time .
he is used to addressing and resolving tricky problems .
we must resolve the issue of which is to be the competent court .
working with you has also been a lot of fun .
i would just like to emphasise two aspects .
that concludes question time .
i therefore voted for the amended version of this report .
the honourable member is clinging onto speculation regarding which the council can not comment further .
we only have one year now to use it .
secondly , in the air , too , the european patchwork must be done away with once and for all .
together this means barely eur 20 million annually for each country which is part of the project .
in category 5 last year , eur 70 million was underspent .
obviously , only women can get pregnant and give birth .
we have good , and in some cases outstanding , research capacities .
some of these are extremely problematic sites .
the southern hemisphere and the us were calling on the wto for a monopoly on wheat and oilseed .
you have a clear mandate from the house .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it should not be simply up to the council ; parliament must approve them as well .
likewise , education systems need to be changed and improved .
oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see minutes
secondly , i would like to say something in the interests of the dogs themselves .
i should like to add one point here .
that programme promotes three strategic objectives .
they must be adapted according to the possibilities of each country .
anyone would think there is no emergency in that situation !
darfur can not , however , be left in a ‘ security vacuum’ .
– mr president , i support my colleague ’s call for a roll call vote .
however , i must tell you that i will cut you off , if this is not the case .
it is one of the rights of consumers .
these are concerns that must be present in any european strategy for youth .
this is not the case .
that would have been the sale of the century , madam president .
we have reduced the requirements .
we have been on the very brink of a crisis .
i am now going to answer five questions , which are grouped together and cover the same theme .
there is a great deal of cause for concern .
that is also a very important feature of environment policy in the community .
thank you very much , mr moorhouse .
nor do we want preventive wars against terrorism .
tunisia and japan do not apply them in the mediterranean .
between 1994 and 1999 , 1 % of the structural funds ' resources are set aside for innovative actions .
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
this is a long - term measure and i would like to know to what extent it will harm my health .
these countries must be subject to the appropriate sanctions .
question no 64 by josé apolinário ( h-0173/98 )
it would be a failure for all of us .
this is what we should opt for .
so it was not a dispute between greek and turkish cypriots .
that is what the people of the eu rightly expect of us .
trakatellis , viceconte , cabrol and flemming reports
recommendation for second reading rothe ( a5 - 0227/2001 )
mr president , i do not wish to detain you any longer .
now the new government , as the commissioner already mentioned , has a somewhat different philosophy .
it is possible to create jobs in a third sector .
can you specify the exact point ?
are we then going to kill off european businesses if we move to 30 % ?
this is the commission 's point of view .
in addition we have various directives .
the aim is that the convention should be ratified before the end of the year .
european efforts are needed to save this treaty .
what does the council intend to do in this important area ?
this is half - hearted and inconsistent .
with this in mind , i would ask each one of you , however , to be fair to the commission .
pulling the strands together practically is crucial .
i hope that has been entered in the record .
for this fundamental reason , i voted against the proposed resolution .
today , the business world sees and treats children as important consumers .
the latest dialogue meeting was held in hanoi last week , on 11 december .
but i also think that it reflects a concern about the resources that are available .
the incidence of these substances in people working in the recycling industry is 70 times higher .
this morning , 76 citizens from different countries had chosen to take part in the debate .
mr president , i really am finishing .
( the president cut off the speaker )
there are always steps forward .
i would never accept a europe that was simply an economic market .
or for the millions whose jobs are in jeopardy or who are living in poverty ?
we have regulated their fishing since 1983 , so for 26 years .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks to the rapporteurs .
i agree with you in recognising that the european union must not impose diktats .
but this is not a happy ending .
that is exactly what the cyber - security task force is proposing .
we will certainly continue to do so .
it is now 10 years since the berlin wall came down .
i have no active verification from the two people you named .
from the point of view of ordinary finns , the person in question would be in receipt of an unacceptably large amount of money .
it was of immense significance internationally .
in my talks with the united states authorities , i hope to be firm .
in other words , we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters .
i am not blind , and i will continue to say that it was the wrong policy .
i should like the council and commission to take action on this score .
this is therefore not about harmonising driving times .
coastal zone management in europe
( the sitting was suspended from 10.35 a.m. until the vote at 11 a.m. )
the ecological debt burdens everyone without exception .
it is therefore not our responsibility in the eu to interfere in this issue .
that is a disastrous situation because we often ask ourselves why our development aid does not work .
very well , but which budgets are going to pay for them ?
what stage have we reached ?
such friends are valuable at this time .
i speak as a representative of the new italian socialist party .
this is exactly what the european directive facilitates , with mrs van den burg 's amendments .
the energy sector is the driving force behind economic growth .
this is another demand that is primarily of a political nature .
finally , there are other proposed amendments which seem to be too mutually contradictory for the commission to support them .
i just wanted that point to be made .
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
in my view we must recognise , first of all , that there is a kurdish question .
we are not being political in this , mr cashman : our response has been less than adequate .
eu law bears witness to this , but so do constitutional provisions of each of the member states .
in the calendar proposed , there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009 .
the debate is closed .
the president cut the speaker off
the numbers are astounding - in the millions , not thousands or hundreds of thousands .
on this point too , i am open to any technical proposal that you wish to make .
sadly we can not erase mr vanhecke 's party and 30 % of flanders .
i am against the motion .
we have had a very good debate in the chamber .
there are several other member states besides romania that have similar concerns .
my five minutes are up .
please convey the best wishes of the house to mrs bjerregaard .
i shall start with a few reflections on the european constitutional treaty .
so they face the dual interest which you have delineated .
consequently , i welcome your suggestions .
there is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no - fly zone .
the debate is closed .
we have already experienced large increases in the price of food products , last august .
commerce does not want any limitations .
an agreement would considerably facilitate community financial policies .
( pt ) madam president , prevention is always better than cure when it comes to disasters .
this will certainly please your rapporteur .
these are the people we must respond to .
madam president , i will be very brief .
let me be clear : it is not a question of turning europe into a fortress .
a key feature of eu transport policy is durability .
this is a task that the council should have carried out .
after all , they have the most to lose if their forests are removed .
there is a risk .
however , the responsibility for control primarily lies with the member states .
in the quite proper debate on concentration , these points must not be lost .
this must apply to the very substance of the commitments in question .
i want to make clear what i have said publicly before .
we are perhaps experiencing a fairy tale , but all fairy tales have their crises , their tears , their moments of fear .
this is why i voted in favour of mr medina ortega 's proposals .
vatanen report ( a5 - 0327/2001 )
those who are not convicted should be treated as innocent .
other traps may be used only if they are not cruel to animals .
in my view it certainly could have been more ambitious .
president trajkovski , you are very welcome to the european parliament today .
speight should not be let off the hook .
this is something we will need to talk about later on .
it seems to me that this is a position which none of the parties want .
in my view , it should be mandatory for them to be listed on the transparency register .
so how will that work out in practice ?
farassino report
for these reasons , we should give this report our full support .
we will , however , have to look carefully at the exact wording .
their fate has been a matter of concern for the european parliament since the 1990s .
the european   union is now setting sail to the east .
apparently , this is for the fight against corruption and organised crime .
that must not be allowed in any case .
that is where the challenge lies .
of course , it is obvious that you have no experience of this .
so , no different treatment in one member state than in another .
any irregularities in certification are reported to the appropriate authorities .
these are my comments on what happened today .
they fought for this right , which is based on intergenerational solidarity .
have we really learned nothing from our experience with asbestos ?
i just hope that the programme will be implemented appropriately .
to keep investment coming in , europe must increase its relative attractiveness .
the commission 's right to initiative is infringed upon .
yet i do have a supplementary .
in a way he was right .
in that way , we enhance the traceability of polluters .
however , the supplementary question is also a reasonable one .
we are not going to go back to a debate on the main substance of the issue .
19 . discharge 2005 : eurojust ( vote )
the nafta has been signed and mexico has been bled dry .
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr voggenhuber on his report .
the criticism is levelled over and over again - and , i think , rightly - that we do not engage in debate .
this report is more than a mere stock - taking exercise .
obviously , every subsequent expansion will encounter an increasingly strict application of the criteria .
so far there are none except for the two i mentioned .
it would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue .
i would like to thank the commissioner , mr dimas , who handled this .
why between denmark and ireland ?
accident trauma must not be increased by legal trauma .
this injustice must be eliminated , especially in such a sensitive area .
that has been the flavour of the week .
that is what you told me in september 2000 , a year ago .
in writing . - following the ordinary legislative procedure : ( first reading )
4 . a declaration of a clear political commitment to the full emancipation of women .
it concerned mr jay lee , who had been a member of aslef and the british national party .
i understand only too well the feelings of the families of the ' disappeared ' .
that is what everyone is wondering .
everyone wishes that we could define a european model for agriculture .
we would be prepared to consider thursday .
any solution sets a precedent .
north korea has gone from bad to worse as a result of her self - imposed isolation .
the hunters knew that they had something to hide .
the implementation of the nabucco project is exceptionally important in this regard .
the dissolution of the nepalese parliament does not help the situation of the common nepalese people .
reconstruction is necessary , but europe has yet to conceive a policy for the region .
( the president cut off the speaker )
how should the fight against the crisis in europe and the world be coordinated ?
we can do that at any time .
you can argue as much as you like but i shall stick to the same position .
where are we with this matter today ?
a joint action plan also needs a joint fund .
on the contrary , it means more red tape , increased costs and risks to patients .
we currently have a debate ongoing about flexicurity .
participation by the local population was very low – almost non - existent .
the commission 's task is to monitor that .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it is my very great pleasure to give the floor to the french president , mr jacques chirac .
accordingly , i , along with others in my group , will give my unqualified support to the rapporteur ' s report .
you conceded very little .
the aim of these three is to make some clarifications which the commission considers to be essential .
they also want cultural diversity to be the ambassador of europe in the world .
all things considered , though , we have not really had much success with this .
this resolution is not really about any of these things .
we do not want that to happen .
napoletano report ( a4 - 0172/98 )
we must not skimp on this question , especially now that we are introducing a community patent .
we had a lot of experts in the committee , that is true .
consumption , however , has not decreased .
the most important thing of all is how effectively they are enforced .
gender considerations have to be taken into account through gender mainstreaming .
we few members of this house here present know what we think .
large countries , and many smaller ones too , often tyrannise others through language .
in total , we are talking about up to half a million people to a greater or lesser extent in need of humanitarian assistance .
that is the content of our motion for a resolution , and i would ask you to vote on it now .
we have seen this morning in this eu parliament self - congratulation and backslapping .
an in - depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .
b5 - 0144/01 by mr van den bos and mrs dybkjær , on behalf of the eldr group , on the congo .
instead of more freedom , hauliers are faced with more restrictions .
dear mr cox , congratulations on your victory .
we must take both immediate and long - term action .
the european united left has three main areas that we would like particularly to highlight :
question no 33 by piia - noora kauppi ( h-0483/03 ) :
those who turn a blind eye to what has been happening for three years now in iraq ?
that is something that also emerged extremely clearly from lech walesa ’s speech yesterday .
it was not a great result - just 67 % of the people !
but it will also be up to member states ' legislatures to safeguard this .
it is all the institutions together that give life to the european union .
the draft convention also contains several other weaknesses .
in the name of freedom of thought , we must vote in favour of this report .
but , having said that , i still feel i must criticise the commission for the method it has used .
in other words , more or less everything can be classified as secret .
we are against violence , against the death penalty and also against terrorist violence as a matter of principle .
the following points were among those voiced by the rapporteur :
the most controversial area is the issue of doctors in training .
we could easily hold debates , however , with the associations to which they belong .
responsibility for this lies with the iraqi government .
no commissioner has tried that before .
we have a moral responsibility to treat animals well .
the joint debate is closed .
these accidents have led to measures which have , however , proved insufficient each time .
one of the biggest reasons for that has been the control of detergents .
we will therefore be voting against this text , which has been drawn up for , and on behalf of , employers .
madam president , this is a strange , uncomfortable and schizophrenic report .
i wanted to raise this point yesterday , but you did not authorise me to intervene .
they will all be necessary .
firstly , the motto you have chosen is ' europe without barriers ' .
the road to the european union passes through diyarbakir , the capital of turkish kurdistan .
we shall have other such debates , moreover .
these measures would do much to foster a culture of transparency .
we simply will not manage it .
its citizens therefore have both a european and a national identity .
i hope that we shall then also obtain the house ’s full support .
which measures does she intend to deploy to persuade china to cooperate more fully ?
but here we turn a blind eye .
in 35 cases , i issued a critical remark .
women are under - represented in senior management .
in hungary , in the area between the danube and the tisza rivers , the sandy plain is actually experiencing serious desertification .
specific proposals will consequently be made in the course of the forthcoming reform strategy .
unfortunately , there is also a direct danger of a war against disobedient georgia .
we ought to help these developing countries .
mr president , my name is schiedermeier !
we believe they should be .
the singapore conference showed that perfectly clearly .
the outcome of copenhagen was deeply disappointing , but we must now move forward .
incidentally , the same thing is happening in many of the eu member states .
madam president , countries should be founded on law .
the conditions are in place , however .
.nothing in mr   catania ’s report on european citizenship was worthy of support .
another is the lack of cooperation between businesses and universities .
we never said it would be an easy task .
( sv ) my understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .
also , in my opinion , mr president , there is also a question of personal style .
i think that is legitimate .
we can talk as much as we want , but fine words are not enough .
( sl ) madam president , we europeans are living with an interesting paradox .
mr president , i want to speak on two matters .
every one in five europeans will contract a disease that causes memory loss .
we accept the financial content of the commission 's communication as the starting point .
we are living through one of the darkest days of the european parliament .
any delay will be bad for business and any delay will jeopardize jobs .
this dialogue with the united states is being continued .
then people will have work and they themselves will take care of the development of their countries .
we would like to retain this for the benefit of the consumer .
i therefore welcome the commission ’s statement , in that it achieves clarity .
question no 52 by ( h-0960/01 ) :
thank you even for your sceptical comments .
the former socialist minister repeatedly refused that request .
you all know the consequences , insofar as we can estimate them at all at this stage .
before the vote on amendment no 5 :
if that is not done , other things should not be discussed either .
the euromed region is , in that respect , a strategically important region for us .
but the language used is splendid .
and there are social reasons too .
in the eu , people have donated billions ; one television programme in germany brought in eur   40 million .
that is why we constantly make powerful appeals to both parties .
but that did not happen .
a third and final point : the rapex system needs to be improved .
the second point is the need for control by the port state .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
ladies and gentlemen , we will now attempt to hold an orderly vote .
we must also embark on the coordination of national policy .
in energy - intensive industry this of course represents a disadvantage for competitiveness .
there is far too much emphasis on their rights rather than on their duties and responsibilities .
it is with this in mind that i ask you to support our request .
they have cellars and vaults full of pictures for which no display space is available .
this would also contribute to an improved use of funds .
we have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise .
14 . mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund ( lithuania and spain ) (
in addition , a green paper on agricultural product quality was presented last year .
what has been put before this house can certainly not be described in those terms .
we have already managed to successfully avoid it once .
that is why there are various proposals for compromise .
it really is a parliament of charlatans that has spoken this morning .
recent events show that we still have a long way to go .
moreover , as of 2007 , the european union has an exit to the black sea .
commissioner , i should like you to answer that question .
as rapporteur , mrs theorin would like to ask a further question .
a multilateral agreement on investments in an oecd context makes sense , therefore .
if we want to be successful , the establishment of new enterprises is especially important .
we only have to think about it .
what , then , are our priorities ?
we share the pope 's view on solidarity and generosity .
just like us , their families must be able to live by their work .
but let me assure you that this concern is very much in hand in the bureau .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sometimes i do not believe what i hear .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what a difference !
you started your presidency with the reputation of being climate - sceptics .
we know the statistics , which are worrying .
we have to come to a more balanced vision of things .
it is often forgotten that all this is included in this package .
the priority is for trapping to continue .
i have three reflections to share with you .
i sincerely hope that the enlarged european union will not prove to be a disappointment for anyone .
president - in - office , i hope that will be high on your agenda .
that is where we must start .
parliamentary immunity : see minutes
firstly , what are the solutions to the current crisis ?
that is something we are not prepared to accept .
in my view , mr president , the answer to both these questions is no .
we have therefore voted against the whole of this resolution .
secondly , with regard to the amounts , for the moment no one can say what these may be .
that was the motive behind the four fifths .
so that is not necessarily the most attractive solution although one can continue to reflect on it .
we need others to match the flexibility the european union has already shown .
that can not be solidarity .
subject : abolition of duty - free sales
however , i think that we should go beyond mere words of solidarity .
there would have been a real problem ! '
mr president , mr   bolkestein offers to visit skye .
we feel that the commission has an important role to play in this respect .
none of these principles is satisfactorily enshrined in the text which came out of amsterdam .
( pl ) mr president , there are just two issues in this debate to which i should like to draw attention .
i agree .
i am in any case grateful for your understanding .
that should be our motto for the future too when we talk about using energy .
it is a sentence spoken by the spanish prime minister josé maría aznar in 1998 .
however , what little is given may relieve their pain .
report kauppi ( a5 - 0466/2001 )
the third thing he mentioned is that financial supervision is being conducted on too national a basis .
so far , this convention has been ratified by 26 member states and also by the community .
i refer , of course , to the death of george best .
however , this does not conflict with the amendment tabled by my group .
i voted against because of the explanatory statement concerning growth and turkey .
asem ii in april has a solid agenda .
sperm counts are falling , while rates of testicular cancer and breast cancer are rising .
the water levels continue to rise .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i would like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
all those concerned understand the need to conclude by june .
the accusations are so serious that it is imperative that they be investigated , and quickly .
we have an investment rate of only 19 % of gdp in europe today .
written statements ( rule 149 )
i urge the commission to grant them this status .
there are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of european industry .
it is very important , therefore , that the responsible commissioner give a clear direction .
my group is divided over this issue .
a serious investigation into how the system will react in critical moments will then be needed .
we will catch up .
it would certainly have greater significance for a wider europe .
people support the fight against corruption at every level of government .
however , improvements should be allowed to continue .
mr šefčovič , who is preparing this proposal , has not told us what it involves .
i think that article 3 is better than amendment no 4 .
through this , we are giving , amongst other things , a clear response to the much - discussed ' whistle - blower ' question .
as its author is absent , question no 47 lapses .
the debate is closed .
time and again they come up against serious difficulties as regards the granting of rights of way .
we must also address the issue of terrorist financing .
orlando report(a4 - 0349/97 )
it might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent .
we must fasten rules around ourselves .
this poses no problem .
it goes far further than we could support .
the council have used creative accounting to find eur 420 million .
( after the speech by mrs harms , see item 4.1 ) .
it is not possible to answer it any more precisely .
almost one third of polish farmers are young people under the age of 40 .
( mixed reactions )
secondly , there are over 45   million disabled people in the eu .
i should like to raise another very important matter too , mr   president .
the debate is closed .
any body which as been around for fifty years makes changes in order to address new challenges .
we will need to act boldly on this .
however , in the main , its statements still hold true and are striking .
is the council ' on schedule ' with its preparations ?
national problems can only be solved jointly , that is on a european scale .
will the commissioner tell us what she thinks about that ?
the treaties can be amended only by unanimity .
how should the operators of the universal service be chosen ?
this silent human rights crisis shames our world .
i accept amendments nos 3 , 4 and 7 .
an extremely significant question about the future is handled in paragraphs 6 and 7 .
public intervention is indeed able to resolve this problem of access .
this amounts to a form of additional financing through the courts .
yes , there is a green paper about food law .
we must make sure that area of research forms part of the programme .
we also agree that advertising has no place in children ’s programmes .
the commission questions the justification for regulation in these sectors .
under the decisions taken , the whole of cyprus will accede .
the problem is a collective one .
there are countries which receive amounts far in excess of their entire production .
this matter will also be dealt with in that report .
you can not just turn your back on this problem .
certainly , i would be in favour of the approximation of that legislation , but this is a different issue .
those debates may run over into question time .
i wish to thank everybody involved in this process .
therefore , this amendment is acceptable only in part .
we must also move the region beyond the era of war .
the ground water is heavily contaminated with mercury , and that is not going to go away .
we have to bear this in mind in our work on the climate .
ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago .
its economy now resembles america ’s to a greater degree .
let us be frank .
nor has the commission yet produced its progress report .
those are my questions , mr president , commissioner .
we want to take the initiative here during our presidency .
recommendation for second reading by mr van dam ( a5 - 0469/2001 )
sometimes this calls for mergers of activities .
it meets the need for common energy and foreign policies .
some of these negotiations have already ended and others are set to conclude by 2010 .
we can no longer turn a blind eye ; we must go to iraq and understand what is happening .
and , although it is true that there have been agreements , it is also true that it has not been possible to conclude many other agreements .
for a second time in three years , the issue is on the agenda .
this prevented several thousand lay - offs .
croatia is , as we all know , one of these countries .
what , therefore , is meant by criteria of an environmental character ?
thank you , commissioner vitorino .
we ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems , not exacerbate them .
since joining the eu , lithuania has experienced a massive ' brain drain ' .
i would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
the debate is closed .
i think we have seen some limited progress in this pre - election process .
we also had quite different views on the solidarity fund . i would say two things here .
many people have fled the tyranny , often to europe .
approval of the minutes
in spain , just 32 % of the registered voters supported the text .
this means there is no guarantee that the system will always be available .
this is a very important point .
the consequences of introducing the euro in slovakia , especially ...
i would remind you of the case of the cruise liner .
the fisheries agreements should not be concluded at all within the framework of the eu .
( sustained applause )
mr prodi did not react to the outcome of the hearings .
the proposal has been framed in such a way that it can be applied by businesses of any size .
in that case , what is the significance of the europe that we want to build ?
mr president , the result has come about after a whole series of infringements of the law .
the environment suffered as a result of the political games played by representatives of the member states .
the next item is question time ( b6 - 0002/2006 ) .
and more likely that not the farmers are the victims and not the perpetrators .
our task as elected representatives is not to act as ambassadors for slovenia , croatia , serbia or bosnia .
doctors must continue to be the main source of information on medicinal products .
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
this could also offer a good basis for multilateral cooperation in the region .
well done .
but let us return to my starting - point .
mr president , a bilderberg meeting will open in versailles tomorrow .
this is very much on their minds .
so we have not forgotten it ; we are working on it .
then a second point of communality .
we had to disappoint a large number of colleagues .
i think that there are three arguments for doing so .
i am very grateful to commissioner schreyer that she opposed the figures .
if one member state is being blackmailed by a supplier , it should speak out .
it is a shared competence based on article 251 of the treaty .
we have to keep that separate .
emphasising investment is all well and good , but networks and knowledge need investment too .
they have been going on not for just one day or one month , but for 50 years .
please help us to be efficient , mr president .
the commission is perfectly well informed , because it has received the questions and has put them in order .
we are already on the road to regionalisation .
i hope this will be extended to all central asian countries .
the debate is closed .
furthermore , what we have to do , as has been said before , is to tackle the roots of terrorism .
that money could be put to many other uses .
an initial analysis has been produced and will form the basis for future work .
the report of mrs kinnock is excellent .
the vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
. that is an interesting question .
i regard this as an example of an area where the subsidiarity principle can come into its own .
let me just point out one thing .
what could happen with all the mines dumped on the seabed ?
.   –    there is nothing new about problems relating to freedom of the press in algeria .
in other words , prevention is much better than cure and is , similarly , much better than compensation .
i am not suggesting that is what the eu has done before .
in this respect , i would like to refer to the codification of community law .
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .
will we remember the well - known phrase ' bon pour l'orient ' ?
in rwanda we hope to have approximately 300 shortly and in burundi something of the order of 170 .
the last speaker said that a small - scale nato is emerging .
in addition , agricultural soils and plants draw large quantities of co2 from the atmosphere .
and then , impact assessments , in order to see if what we are doing is the right way .
in fact , their impact prevents development policies from being effective .
benchmarking has been mentioned .
the american government , too , bears some responsibility for this process .
vote ( continuation )
yet even gaddafi 's son suggested that there was a link between the two deals .
in this regard , we are in complete agreement with the european trade union confederation ( etuc ) .
if not , we will put the euro , one of the great successes of european integration , at risk .
the same applies to the european union .
i have worked with her in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection on consumer protection issues for many years .
mr wathelet is a little sad ; he has the impression that too little has been done .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the competitor was the gliwice factory , in poland .
which member states have caused difficulties in the implementation of what the commission has requested ?
- madam president , this is a dreadful piece of legislation .
the member states must not be forced to impose one particular vision of flexicurity .
it is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the structural funds .
membership of committees and delegations : see minutes
i am sorry to interrupt you .
that way i think we maintain speed in the whole process .
nobody is now left unaware of that .
we have no difficulty in accepting that .
no doubt it was too late for that .
the rise of bootlegged alcohol in many member states is also a factor .
- thank you mr president - in - office of the european council .
question no 2 by inger schörling ( h-1236/98 ) subject : echelon
for this reason the message you conveyed to us today was a good one .
we must continue moving forward .
one would hope it can be rectified .
b5 - 0347/2000 by mr collins , on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group ;
we heard that there was not a chance in hell that there would be any change in the financial perspective .
the report makes only one mention of nato , seemingly as an afterthought .
to a certain extent this is true .
behold the unmasked eu !
we must be fully aware of this .
it must be submitted to the control and to the impulse of parliament .
the extent of the problem is immense .
there are problems , and they are by no means trivial .
for them , you are too modern .
subject : eu - russia relations : spanish presidency agenda
we wish her a very enjoyable stay .
so , we have a contradiction in our text , and if we want to be effective we have to remedy this .
the vote will take place at 12 noon .
the european union has been responsible for its policy in the middle east since january 2006 .
the poor are hungry , have no jobs , and fear disease .
we all know the moral arguments for enlargement of the union .
( the minutes were approved )
none of the things going on there are irrelevant to european culture , economy and society .
( applause from the pse group )
the prices are falling for farmers , but not for consumers .
the technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists .
our activities have effects on the local population .
for those reasons , the commission can not accept amendment no 1 .
in writing . - the european union is the world 's biggest economy .
let us not be under any illusions .
i would be grateful if you could answer precisely .
the introduction of the single currency will not only further integration .
we still need more jobs in rural areas .
more than anything else , early intervention is crucial .
the delegation is headed by the parliament 's president , elena torres miranda .
therefore , i am looking forward now to starting the procedure for 2011 .
i thank the presidency for that reply .
they can never become members of the european union .
the chinese communist party is prevailing .
there are important interests involved .
such a policy will ensure that the entire population receives a satisfactory income .
both sides have been guilty of weaknesses and oversights .
we should get rid of block voting in the joint assembly .
this phased plan must include the social dimension .
in the transport area , for instance , our commitment is to sustainability .
the european parliament is currently the most important agent for promoting human rights .
i commend this legislation .
the political and economic reforms go together .
the proposals in the field of research are at the core of the delivery of the new lisbon agenda .
before the vote on the resolution on religious freedom in china
there should not be any delay in dealing with this obvious international emergency .
from 2012 we will have a schengen airspace .
this situation now represents a security risk for the entire region .
there is also stress on the importance of legal recognition .
i feel it would be extremely educational and very interesting .
this assessment certainly includes some positive aspects .
indeed , it is already used in some countries .
i hope that the shutdown of the yongbyon plant goes ahead by mid - april .
i am happy to answer any questions .
that is the clear consequence of this .
that was stated in the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen of 1789 .
madam president , i will concentrate on social aspects of this report .
but the worst is still to come .
we need to ensure that this is not the case .
that too is something , i am pleased to say , that we have obtained .
we accept a minimum standard , but eu regulation must end there .
the positions are identical to those of ten years ago .
who has played a part in this game ?
this subject in my view is no exception .
you will not have to wait too long .
gothenburg is the appropriate setting to open this worldwide debate .
there is a huge potential here for the use of renewables .
the eu commission intervened continually : interfered in the process .
i believe that this really is an important project for the future .
south sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable sovereign state .
however , we should also ensure that the european union does not labour under the illusion that europe is becoming safer by slamming the door permanently shut . in short , we should not raise any false expectations but we should not turn our backs on the east either .
this is in no sense designed to stop that .
it is therefore unacceptable to put the cart before the horse .
fishing is important for food , and also ensures a variety of jobs .
the composition of this group will be published in the minutes of this part - session .
i think that this is an area of serious concern , as has already been said .
adopting regulations does not change the nature of production .
mr president , i have two observations with regard to the minutes .
mr bösch is right . this is the moment of truth for mr prodi ' s commission .
in short , the commission upholds its proposal .
therefore , in reality the aid will go to large enterprises in large countries .
in my opinion , this measure comes under the non - road mobile machinery directive .
we can not jolt our governments ' consciences .
violence against women is unacceptable .
in my country alone , assets measurable in billions are dependent on this approach .
we need the ambitious strategy of change decided in lisbon .
i congratulate the rapporteur .
the problem of energy or energy - intensive industries merits a separate reply .
these people are also excluded from its scope .
like its predecessor , the constitution , it foundered on the rock of democracy .
we , of course , want to avoid any such eventuality .
further , this plan does not concern eurostat alone .
similarly , we would like to highlight the paltry amount of credits made available .
he did nothing more than was his duty as a journalist and a citizen .
in 2001 , serbia was the new concern , whereupon there was slightly less interest in the former priorities .
i wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this outcome .
is the president - in - office of the council prepared to pass on this request ?
everything will depend on how the agreements reached are implemented on the ground .
we shall attend to this in due course .
the report follows in the same direction .
subject : the eu as an association of free and independent states
that is a fantastic project , and people understand it and support it .
oral explanations of vote
once again it is a matter of a coup d'état on the part of the big countries .
i should therefore like to know what planning will take place in future .
these three factors indicate a development parallel to that of the european union .
that in fact is the point on which i should like to speak .
public openness is a major factor in that process .
mr president , i am pleased that the commission has taken this issue seriously .
written explanations of vote
this must be done on the basis of the guarantees provided by the rule of law .
this leads me to the following comment regarding the revision clause .
other than that , i am of the view that warnings should be kept as brief and punchy as possible .
thank you commissioner .
he has tabled many amendments supported by our group .
it was google that scanned millions of copyright titles from all over the world .
thank you for this first part of the white paper .
we must acknowledge this .
the word ' solidarity ' appears 23 times in the treaty : let us translate the word into action .
schools can no longer remain open .
we believe in reform and democratisation of the wto .
in slovakia this broadcasting has an 80-year - old tradition .
which is right , of course .
that is , eur 18 million per year .
i would also like to say something about the question of monitoring and the implementation of fisheries legislation .
that is about reconfirming our values , mr bütikofer .
that means the programmes have to be of a high quality .
well done for this initiative !
so i genuinely apologise for that misunderstanding .
i support the call to end the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals for slaughter .
i should like to thank minister haarder for being here .
i would call on the commission to do everything possible to ensure that we europeans abide by the rules .
you could say that the arena is now entirely open for us in this area .
that must be very obvious to us all .
allow me to highlight the following cases .
but the discussion ought in fact to focus on whether there is going to be chaos or whether things will run smoothly .
their parents and children are not allowed access to healthcare .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i am interested in the number of roll call votes we have been having on this report .
both are very beneficial from a nutritional point of view .
this is a great day for education policy throughout europe .
we will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here .
we are all sure that 2008 is going to be very exciting , to say the least .
i do not want to use stronger words .
the main lesson of cancún is linked to the rising power of the southern ' bloc ' .
a second point on the optional protocol .
whether you call it genocide or not , the situation is very serious .
it is absolutely essential .
energy is being dealt with as a commodity rather than as a common asset .
it is a step in the right direction .
it is worth mentioning that the report does enshrine a broad consensus on a number of key issues .
it is our partner in nato and deserves to be treated as such .
however , more efforts are needed .
at the same time , obviously , the union 's enlargement policy must be respected .
in the united kingdom it is being discussed .
however , we must not be complacent .
in european research , we must take a step forward both qualitatively and quantitatively speaking .
it is impossible to define human rights more simply or poignantly .
parliament already missed the opportunity provided by the convention .
displaced persons ( continuation )
every new business : three new jobs in the european union .
what do we have to offer ?
we have also achieved this .
the committee has , however , been even more realistic than the commission .
the passage in the communication about radioactive waste management is a real gem of vacuity .
could i just start with some facts .
you will appreciate that this task is enormous .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
approval of the minutes
urgent political matters
the vote will take place on tuesday , 8 july 2008 .
we in parliament must endeavour to be the friends of both as well .
this situation is no longer acceptable .
unconditional support is declared , a total acceptance of the united states ' s arrangements .
it is now time to make arrangements for implementation .
gramsci said that optimism of the will is needed to do anything .
mr president , i too should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for her commitment .
this progress does also provide opportunities for development .
question no 33 by ( h-0298/00 ) :
( ro ) mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs podimata .
euro notes are of quite a high quality .
the value of freedom is what unites us .
and thirdly , a society that values entrepreneurship .
tensions are running high .
question time ( commission )
in the last two years , we have reached a number of substantial , concrete results .
different studies can produce different results .
( b5­0361/2000 ) by mrs malmström , on behalf of the eldr group , on tibet ;
i come from portugal , from the other end of europe , and next week i shall be going to russia .
the other question is who should bear the cost .
the reason being that they can not afford long - drawn - out procedures and patent rights .
home childcare must not be detrimental to public childcare services .
i want first of all to deal with paragraph 14 .
if you take away a cornerstone , much more may come tumbling down .
it is a proposal based on logic .
the hopes that we are creating do matter .
i shall therefore vote in favour of this report .
transparency must rule in the future .
here too , there is still work to be done in terms of upholding the codecision principle .
we ask that the use of driftnets be banned in general , irrespective of area .
it will be the guide for the next financial perspectives .
madam president , you are one of a distinguished line which includes louise weiss and simone veil .
that concludes the debate .
that is without precedent in the history of europe and the world .
– mr president , the monitor is still giving the wrong information .
no , not all the attacks on the freedom of the press are the same .
the crisis has led to a 28 % decline in vehicle registrations .
against this background , we must welcome the proposal for a framework decision .
in 2001 , they exceeded 16 % , and they now stand at 7 % .
pre - emptive warfare is no more use than the reintroduction of authoritarian structures .
mr president , i have two points and one question .
we have already debated the situation in iran on many occasions .
chairman of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety . - ( de ) mr president , yes , mrs hassi is right .
it is a matter of reciprocity .
i would like to thank mr surján for his excellent work .
that is why we will support mr trakatellis ' report .
these days that deserves acknowledgement .
they are not going to go away ; they are actually going to grow .
the interests of the local economy are paramount here .
that concludes the speeches on this subject .
i certainly intend to make a real effort to reinforce these policies .
what will happen then ?
what we must do is engage in a constant campaign of awareness - raising and information .
the strategy was bad , because the result is bad .
can it tell us when they will be available ?
since questions no 48 and no 49 deal with similar subjects , they will be answered jointly .
i regard this programme as something like a guide to the lisbon strategy .
leader + will last a year longer than leader 2 .
furthermore , enhanced restrictions and the very threat of financial penalties should act as a deterrent .
( speech shortened pursuant to rule 137(1 ) of the rules of procedure )
only seven per cent of the micro - entities that we are talking about are involved in cross - border activities .
these cuts are extremely problematic .
in spite of it , some members expressed their disagreement with this solution .
i shall now try briefly to explain why .
trade liberalisation in latin america can not be separated from democratisation .
on the issue of the new methods of payment : we intend to take action .
this applies to both the political and the economic sectors .
we now have an intergovernmental conference looking at the treaties again .
let us hope that it does not take five years .
as for the commission , it has been criticized .
i thank you for your answer , commissioner , but my question went a little further than that .
dounreay is in my constituency .
the vote will take place on 19 february 2008 .
the macro - financial assistance proposed today by the eu is more welcome than ever before .
the aim will be to ensure that certain forms of conduct are regarded as punishable offences in all the member states .
there are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers .
mrs senyszyn accused the catholic church of oppressing women .
some of the expenditure is laid down in treaties and old agreements .
the european union has a key role to play in the search for peace .
the same may happen in the future as far as algeria is concerned .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
we had a situation where foot - and - mouth came into the european union .
it is therefore important that we see things in context .
and let me tell mrs grossetête and others that we are not talking about banning plastic .
we are willing to do all of these , and the submitted report talks about all of these .
i should like to commend the points made by our colleague , mrs mcnally .
i therefore voted in favour .
this will enable dobrogea to supply 50 % of national energy consumption .
that amounts to far more than administrative reform .
some countries ban organisations , others do not .
in writing . - ( de ) i have voted against this report .
it is shameful and disgraceful that we are waiting with our arms folded .
prominent amongst them is primarily its further expansion .
olaf must actually be up and running by the end of the year .
the g20 conference also made the dismantling of tax havens one of the key objectives .
we do not know what parliament 's total resources are .
all in all : galileo is not more accurate , and it can not be switched off .
nor did we react jointly when the opec countries raised oil prices .
what does that mean ?
( applause from the right and from the centre )
i thought mr allister 's points were absolutely correct .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
( the minutes were approved )
that is what she said in committee .
it also deals with the issue of child soldiers .
take a close look at article 121 so that you are fully aware of this .
is this really the democratic behaviour called for in the resolution ?
this has all been noted , mr turco .
with this in mind , i support the rapporteur when he :
i fully understand what you are saying .
mrs berès , do you have a procedural motion ?
exceptions should be kept to a minimum .
we are taking numerous steps in this direction .
indeed , the balance of opinion in britain is that political union has already progressed too far .
this needs to be vigorously opposed .
i voted in favour of adopting the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in georgia .
a number of speakers have already made this clear .
europe ’s voters will express their gratitude on 13 june .
we are very mindful of that .
4 . report on the 2009 annual statement on the euro area and public finances (
no , mr elles , this issue has been dealt with .
china is not the only state in this situation , however .
( sv ) in sweden , we have experienced what it means to be in serious debt .
the directive has been announced and i eagerly await it .
the integrated border management and the visa policy should serve these purposes .
. ( da ) the danish social democrats today voted for the three reports indicated .
madam president , reports like that are very damaging to this house .
peace is essential for everyone , it is essential both for the palestinians and for the israelis .
are we here to vote as we were elected to do , or not ?
there are no short cuts to eu membership .
i should not say these things from the chair .
the debate is closed .
cooperation should , however , be intergovernmental .
ninety per cent of the harvest is picked by hand , most of it using child labour .
however , the last six months have been tragic for the people i represent .
it is quite extraordinary that we have this situation .
i should like to hear a reaction from the commissioner on this .
however , the contours of the potential deal are not yet fully there .
of course the agreement is weak , but we have to start somewhere .
what the council finds important , we deem inadequate and one - sided .
the first is on the vice - presidential vote .
as we know , the aims of the cap were formulated under the treaties of rome .
- virrankoski report
at present , it seems that animals have more rights than children in europe .
we have expressed our priorities .
basically because they are two completely different types of figure .
... and you call yourselves democrats , when you do not even listen to what is being said ?
i do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now .
it is said that there is protectionism ; well we must protect our workers , for example .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to see a revision of the rules .
this is the position of the commission and the member states .
furthermore , as president brok said , the quartet must allow intervention on the ground .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
it is necessary to invest in this good relationship .
in respect of mercury the general maximum level is 0.5 mg / kg for fishery products .
unfortunately , woefully few member states have invested 3 % of their gdp in research .
there is no link between them .
such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania .
therefore i should like to make a proposal to the commissioner .
( applause from the non - attached members )
second , the balance sheet of the transatlantic relationship is fundamentally positive .
nor has the usa been so intent on combating inflation .
i also want to congratulate mrs bauer on her report .
i believe that this is of the utmost importance .
i do , however , remain concerned about two points .
this year has been a very successful one for the fyrom .
we should not be bounced into a decision because the council deems it to be necessary .
i shall now put to the vote the request by the group of the party of european socialists .
he was speaking the truth , and the european parliament should help ensure that this is what happens .
they are occupying forces .
( de ) mr president , i voted enthusiastically for the goepel report .
at present , the european union has essential and fundamental tasks to deal with .
this will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further .
the council has attacked the position of the parliament at its core and damaged it !
i see that mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject .
in bringing this speech to a close , let me ask what our weaknesses are .
i am prepared to accept that some of these are harmless .
there are also other deficiencies , however .
our proposal also has to do with article 16 , the country - of - origin principle , which is such a bone of contention .
it will also very much correspond to the philosophy of a europe without internal borders .
alternatively , would the problem be solved by the imposition of fines ?
consequently , we are seeing the burgeoning of a real international market in training .
the outcome of the vote was as follows .
fighting terrorism today also means fighting this poverty .
my last point concerns accountability .
it is the wish of parliament , and we will support you .
we have , in fact , offered assistance to italy .
there are solutions other than price management .
since we are always so self - critical , i believe that we should welcome this step .
.    mr   president , i very much enjoyed listening to all that mrs   vlasto and commissioner   verheugen had to say .
the fate of kosovo has burdened us for many years .
so it provides more opportunities than the cost involved .
the important thing is that the directive should go ahead , mr vidal - quadras .
thank you very much , madam commissioner .
mr president , consumer protection : we are all in favour of it .
both documents are worthless if they are not applicable in practice .
i also think that all the instruments need to be made more effective ...
in the case of djibouti , it is the right to freedom of opinion and freedom of political activity .
i now miss these demonstrations because there , blood is indeed flowing for oil .
5 . 26th annual report on monitoring the application of european union law ( 2008 ) (
the joint debate is closed .
however , the political crisis has disrupted the negotiation process .
the sutherland report provided some interesting ideas in this regard .
thank you , mr president .
the key is that we are talking about regular personnel .
we must apply quite different principles , and that is the purpose of our resolution .
dates for next sittings : see minutes
i can find no women in the top parliamentary service positions .
this is a very important subject .
passenger safety and professional knowledge are at stake .
this bloodshed must be brought to a stop as soon as possible !
in general terms , social policy should be a national responsibility .
nothing has changed since , or at least very little .
naturally , the procedures must be simplified , straightforward and flexible .
such provisions are totally inappropriate in a democratic state .
it is also a question of people 's confidence in the european union .
i would therefore wish mr garriga polledo and my successor every success .
the debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m.
my final point relates to the long - term ' vision zero ' objective .
it has been stated here that this competition has not been very great , at least until now .
it is a limited recommendation , therefore , and i hope that you can see your way to supporting it .
it calls for the compulsory registration of all passengers on board passenger ferries .
this is the first time we have pledged to provide this kind of aid at community level .
that , madam president , ladies and gentlemen , concludes the remarks i wanted to make in connection with this commission proposal .
having said that , it is the sixth ' no ' in nine referendums since the fall of the berlin wall .
our talks are still in their infancy .
the final matter concerns the conclusions .
i will not go into all these areas but highlight a few .
a great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite .
this is not a job for parliament .
i distinguish four key milestones for the coming months .
national governments and other institutions must respond adequately .
the second concerns long - term contracts which are subject to compliance with certain principles .
the commission is not therefore able to accept this amendment in its present form .
moreover , china is not just any old country .
i repeat : focard 's heirs !
are there any comments ?
voters : 592 .
that is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible .
it is constructive because it takes account of the environment .
our group supports approval of the common position as it stands .
this is why i abstained from the vote .
paradoxically , however , the union has not .
the public sector is subordinated to the needs of the monopoly groups it serves .
madam president , it should be recognized that this report contains a number of positive aspects .
mr president , this vote has also been marked by the same attitude .
this is the task of state aid control .
the long journey excuses your tardiness . '
hurricane mitch was a category 5 hurricane .
that does not imply any particular kind of solidarity .
i will spare you the actual texts , but personally i am horrified by them .
that report will also look to the future .
i would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation .
the demands we impose upon others we must also impose upon ourselves .
where is the risk ?
i think that this a good approach .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
the group has therefore chosen to reject the report .
this was coordinated with the directorate - general for competition in cases against rights agencies .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
this neighbour had been having a dispute with him for years over a piece of ground .
yet there is no acquis communautaire , neither in the energy field nor in the nuclear field .
the fourth thing that needs to happen is the delivery of aid to the region .
it is in the union 's interests that the process should have a favourable outcome .
i would therefore like to thank mrs   miguelez   ramos for her excellent work .
i support mr adam 's report .
some might like that , others might disapprove .
japan , australia and the usa are all active .
i disagree with this .
what has happened since then ?
our experts tell me that they think this deadline is too short .
do you accept that it is making genuine efforts in that regard ?
perhaps it will at the next presentation .
we did not in fact support all the amendments .
the information which leaks out indicates suffering on a vast scale .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
( de ) madam president , firstly , i would like to say on the subject of the export ban that i fully agree with mr oettinger .
thank you , mr president , for briefly stating what the question is about .
it is a tall order , but i am confident that we are on the right track .
one in three of us will during our lifetime .
it contains 60 % of the world 's population .
one could ask what exactly the eu is going to do to strive for a deal in durban .
there will need to be legislative changes .
i would just like to refer once again to the example of the united states .
to be honest , i can not understand it .
i regret the fact that the debate was dominated by emotions rather than reason .
this is not a clarification . this is a change of the substance .
the balkans and the middle east demand all our attention .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
how can anyone understand that ?
democracy was born in europe , 2 500 years ago in greece .
mr president , do i owe mr brok anything ?
we must avoid constricting rules that hamper existing schemes .
it is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals .
by early 2008 the number was 50 a day !
what about the corporations governed by public law ?
( hu ) mr president , the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period .
the death penalty also raises another problem : that of judicial error .
the orchestrator of this state terrorism is the 77-year - old dictator robert mugabe .
the next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
for these reasons , we were not able to vote for this report .
in my view , the ppe - de must clarify its own position on this issue too .
the key points addressed in the new text include the following :
it is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights .
the second section of our proposal relates to structural reform .
it is also going to be debated in the human rights council .
this obliges us to speak honestly to the people of europe .
my group will be supporting its general tenor .
i found that many of them are close to financial ruin .
agenda for next sitting : see minutes
in this task , mr manders has done everything he could .
i believe that increasing the bank ' s capital must be conditional upon reforms being carried out .
in short , this safety problem particularly involves the countries of the east .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to say a few words on accidents at sea .
it is a sign that we can not ignore .
it thus received absolutely unequivocal support from both parties .
the name of our group is europe of nations .
he says we should share best practice , which we are not currently doing .
i have also drawn up a series of recommendations to promote pluralism in europe .
this uneven distribution obviously has serious consequences for research and development .
this has been going on for many years .
an additional stimulus is needed .
only then can they be empowered .
not in a material sense or in a cultural sense .
there must be no double standards when it comes to new and old member states .
i voted in favour of the report .
high technology in finland has a place in nearly every walk of life .
much of what we called for has been incorporated in this draft agreement .
in vienna , we have an international meeting , under the umbrella of the united nations .
i emphatically support what mrs gradin has said .
that must be acknowledged now , or else there is little point in continuing .
the situation in tibet is not normal - no , we have voted that it is normal .
i therefore ask you to support this motion for a resolution .
let us help them , commissioner .
i shall now proceed to set out , in brief , just five arguments in favour of european regulation of market access .
in short , the law has rights too .
we can not allow those who have been robbed then to be punished too .
the commission has called for a deadline for reports in september 1998 .
this is basically ices ' way of saying that it is in deep trouble .
that much can be learned from reports on such matters .
that would be the best policy for the environment , mr president .
many reports are complex and lengthy .
it remains subject to the federal authority of the federal republic of the united states of america .
industry needs certainty of planning , and in that regard europe has very much surged ahead .
my report has 120 sections .
that is part of today ’s agreement .
this may entail reprioritising parts of their operational programmes .
the only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past . "
ii . seizing europe ’s opportunities
we have therefore probably been too modest up until now .
we should certainly not tamper with the chapter on monetary union and make amendments to it .
that is the point i have tried to make , so it is far from ' one size fits all ' .
i am pleased to see that several of these aspects are well covered by mr rübig ' s report .
after that there were various interventions .
however , we are not discussing it for the first time .
this proposal has a rather dramatic history .
community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision .
i voted against it for these and other reasons .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i did not back the lehne resolution .
one word needs to be altered in amendment no 2 .
this is the last thing our citizens want to see .
to put it briefly , two parties - two truths , no gas .
if the eu is to succeed in the context of global competition it will have to be made more competitive .
we are proposing a number of amendments to you .
the additional information about the fact that the commission is evaluating certain legislative plans does not help in this respect .
this is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operators .
i , indeed , have a lot of expectations on that score .
consequently , this is one of the prevailing conflicts between the various ethnic groups .
finally , a reserved service has been organized .
one can not simply ignore this subject .
deliver , do not talk !
therefore , you will find that these issues remain at the top of our agenda for next year .
one - minute speeches on matters of political importance
this is a very serious issue , which requires a more general response .
i will watch developments with care .
certainly , we want to implement a clear overall concept .
these blue cards allow a member to ask another member a question .
we have done our homework .
i think that is the answer expected of us .
we just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances .
in this respect , i should like to make a concrete proposal .
dates for next sittings : see minutes
at the same time , sources argue that every other prostitute in paris is from moldova .
that is why it is our task to put that into practice .
we should continue along this path .
we often say the right things here .
women are the poorest and suffer most from illness in the developing countries .
this is different , it seems to me – but let us drop the matter .
mrs peijs distinguished between minimum and maximum harmonisation .
our health professions are monitored .
the worldwide web and the internet has developed into a phenomenal medium .
perhaps it is a good thing for a few of us here to speak out and say that .
the time has come to discuss this issue openly .
lingering in refugee camps , their fate attracts no international attention .
mr president , i would ask you to intervene in order to solve this problem .
the two honourable members will be pleased with one particular aspect .
mr president , i would like to support what mr daul has just said .
the stability pact is called stupid or rigid .
let me also , at this point , make an observation as a german .
mr president , first of all , i should like to thank all the speakers for their comments .
i do not bear any grudge against my colleague .
the issue , therefore , is not about the idea of the european union .
however , having been through the council ' s mangle , it undeniably looks less impressive .
secondly , i would like to say a few words about violence in the family .
this is right .
there has been a great deal of talk about the railways over the past ten years , but it has done little to help .
as i have already said , we have prioritized the importance of rural development .
i will take this opportunity to ask that all forms of violence , without equivocation or exception , be targeted .
i would like to look briefly at the european training foundation ( etf ) .
from the outset i have supported the maastricht treaty and called for more .
the common position is to be welcomed , and it is a good basis for the second reading .
sport will , at this point , be dealt with like any other business activity .
what kind of example is this supposed to set for the candidate countries ?
the interesting issue is to look at why that fall has happened .
thank you , mrs kinnock .
i would like this minuted , please .
do the us intelligence services keep their european counterparts up to date ?
of those applications checked , over 40 % were inaccurate .
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members .
i believe that , when the citizens ' initiative is implemented , we will ensure that it remains so .
this then is a european people .
the eu is an association of 15 independent states .
the second circle groups together the existing 27 countries of the eu .
it is because we have gone out of our way to make it hard for them .
presentation of the court of auditors ' annual report - 2006 ( debate )
we know the facts .
mr bloom , i can not say anything about the circumstances to which you are referring .
this applies to all areas , not just to mr   barnier ’s portfolio .
– madam president , i know the rapporteur , mr   purvis .
we must therefore move away from risk management towards risk removal .
( ga ) mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
there may be no safe fragrance for some allergic individuals .
on the other hand , europe was obviously not ready for that .
the main point can be summed up by just one word : ambition .
was europe really silent on this ?
are they going to make proposals for the surveillance of the ' outs ' ?
having said that , i am very critical of this document overall .
the commission and the council will review progress in november .
please forgive me for saying so , but this is not satisfactory .
we are going to have two regulations : one about the patent itself , and the other about the language system .
this is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance .
i voted in favour of the report , of course .
a single nomenclature , the combined nomenclature , will be used for external and intra - european statistics .
i find transport infrastructure , sustainable economy and environmental protection to be the key areas .
subject : duty - free shopping
judicial protection is patchy in europe .
we can read it together afterwards .
there are just a few acp countries that have succeeded in exploiting cotonou to the maximum .
we must congratulate ourselves on this .
small seed associations will go out of existence for economic reasons .
nine out of 13 members of the basle committee are members of the european union .
all the same , it is incredible , this whole business !
counting fish is not difficult ; it is like counting trees .
full monitoring by the interested parties should also be arranged .
it is a smoke screen to enable mass immigration .
this seems to us to be the most serious aspect of the whole issue .
i have to stress that within the european parliament , we took our work very seriously .
this demand is also aimed at the two european members of the united nations security council .
the latter account for 70 % of existing methane .
this is where a clear dividing line must be drawn between solidarity and subsidiarity .
these do not follow the stabilisation and association agreements , but cut right across them .
mr president , the commission green paper does not offer anything new .
even if the sets are different makes and models , they can be charged simultaneously .
mobility is important , as stated at the workshop in prague .
are you representing the usa , or are you representing the european union ?
this is an essential element of the environment debate .
this agreement must be respected and compliance with it monitored .
everyone will benefit from this agreement , but it has clearly been too long in coming .
decisions are taken here that sometimes have considerable financial implications .
i am thinking of a variety of crises which require cooperation and solidarity .
it is up to parliament to be quite clear on how it will carry out control .
i am sorry that i can not stay for the end of the debate .
this is why this report is so important .
allow me now to summarise our conclusions and recommendations in four points :
what is the situation , therefore ?
however , for the first time in over 20 years the rate of increase has significantly slowed down .
as you know , 60 % of our market relies on imports and this figure is rising all the time .
the rest will remain anonymous .
i am sure that parliament is most appreciative .
there is a second problem that worries me .
the vote will take place after the debates .
the commissioner has also chosen to present this report during the summit in florence .
it was with the purpose of saving them that we introduced this quorum of 40 back then .
this is incorrect on two counts .
let us call all of these laws , however , because they are laws .
this must be done if only on account of human dignity , but not solely for that reason .
on the second issue , too , we are allowed to talk about the content .
that is a fact , as members know , which i personally very deeply regret .
exercise your role as chairman properly .
i am thinking here of schools , nursery schools and crèches .
i can remember the time when we were taken back to heathrow via dublin .
thank you for pledging to help us get through it .
unfortunately , the council rejects this reform .
we must not bring them home until there is more security in the country .
workforce mobility .
now , the globalisation adjustment fund is also providing direct assistance to people affected in my home country .
the secretary - general , who is present today , is familiar with this document .
i believe that the alternative resolution would have addressed those concerns more effectively .
i voted in favour of this important resolution .
the commission is itself a member of the council of baltic sea states .
written statements ( rule 142 )
what can we do ?
the road map is a plan in three phases .
i hope i am wrong and perhaps he could confirm that i am wrong in that regard .
( text abbreviated in accordance with rule 137(1 ) of the rules of procedure )
i am also concerned from a scottish dimension .
but that does not necessarily go in your favour , mr   barroso .
fifthly , we would insist that transparency is one of our governing principles .
now we have the opportunity to end that suffering .
the csce or madrid conference must now be the model for the next step .
we must clearly develop our methods for the future .
2 . completing the internal market for e - commerce (
in drafting a programme like this any presidency faces a dilemma .
but an innate caution begs the question : what has happened politically ?
many speakers have mentioned hezbollah , but what is also needed now is a government .
mr president , the integrated maritime policy is vital to the european union .
it is extremely important that we stick to that .
this need not , however , mean being sidelined economically . indeed , the opposite is the case .
your reply can only be yes .
it means that nagornokarabakh can not benefit .
but freedom is not licence , and we should be quite clear about that .
the first concerns the requirement for a representative .
i protest against the constant breaches of the principle of subsidiarity in this chamber .
this would have been another useful tool in the fight against terrorism and crime .
it is true that a debate on chechnya took place on 10 april .
indeed , our asian partners also have a role to play in putting pressure on the regime in rangoon .
i thank everybody for their help .
that is why i voted against this report .
from kosovo to serbia - the money transferred along too - and from afghanistan to iraq .
that is the real problem .
that discussion , i believe , has become unproductive and no longer addresses the real issue .
the position is simple .
there is a lot of cruelty to animals during transport .
this totalled more than eur 400 million over the past ten years .
commissioner , when will an inquiry be carried out into this affair and into this sector ?
the pope has asked for this , and so too have foundations , associations and political figures .
the doctored images presented to us conceal horror .
any breach of this principle is punishable .
we have today voted on the eu budget at first reading .
declaration of financial interests : see minutes
now , and i quote once again , the issue is " lifelong learning " .
nothing has happened .
mr president , i am going to make my remarks on the climate change package .
the force is 90 % a protestant organisation ...
the counter attacks by the sharon administration , however painful they are , are a response to this .
then there is the point about guantánamo .
that concludes the one - minute speeches .
mr president - in - office , you have made us in the european parliament eager to leave for lisbon already .
. i wish to draw the attention of the presidency to the euratom treaty .
the british members are upset .
above all it mentions cohesion funds .
but this is not just about more money .
it is an important factor for equilibrium and progress .
i agree .
even after croatia , it will not be possible to draw a new border ; instead progress will have to be made step by step .
however , this report mentions the implementation of the lisbon treaty , which we strongly oppose .
i believe that everyone will see this as a step in the right direction .
subject : pakistani military assets
well , you can imagine what it gets like in the rush hour .
enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for europe .
the commission 's proposal and mrs laperrouze 's report point in this direction .
that leads to an important insight .
firstly , the question of rights .
we did not want to have reports both from the members and from third parties .
the debate is closed .
we all regard kyoto as an important issue , but it does not exactly have much to do with human rights .
the public , however , should know what quality is .
once inside , you will be locked in for ever .
a number of recent cases of this kind spring to mind .
we will be safer if we are freer , more open and more inclusive .
that is what i would have preferred , personally .
mr president , this week the freedom drivers return to parliament .
the problems that we are experiencing would justify this unusual step .
what does the commission intend to do to lift these unilateral trade restrictions in the short term ?
everything must be implemented ; we have given you the resources for this .
i agree with today ' s speakers that parliament must make the council aware of this .
today the union is much enlarged and there are only 6 million farmers .
then there is the definition of a genuine foreign policy .
each member of the commission is responsible and answerable for his department .
is that not worthwhile ?
what we can do is , i think , plain to see .
we must use the community approach .
then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital , berlin .
the polish veto plays a major role .
that is why i think the british aerospace merger with marconi makes good sense .
i now come to my second consideration .
however much the direction taken by the report 's contents may be worthy of approval , in this respect there must be clear improvement .
what i consider to be even more serious , however , is the subject of disappearing .
i think it was a mistake for the council not to accept this .
then we need to ask who we are really trying to make responsible .
i think it is important to mention additives in the report .
in the meantime , economic relations between the eu and china are facing some problems .
growth means investment .
( the president cut the speaker off )
the conference dealt with dangers related to the spread of gmos , and was attended by distinguished scientists from many countries .
there is a very old saying ' give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
29 . 2007 discharge : european agency for safety and health at work (
today , women are still having their vaginas torn apart with bayonets .
there are still many social challenges to be faced .
mr president , commissioner , the european union is like a boat , whose keel is in the mediterranean sea and whose mast is in the baltic .
that is something that the businessmen should note and a lot of trade is going on .
they get better eggs , which taste better .
report : pervenche berès
let us dedicate a minute ’s silence to the victims .
mr president , it is true that we need an international breakthrough in terms of the icao .
. the report before us does not raise any objection to the commission ’s proposal .
that is the result of intensive work lasting over three years .
i am also delighted that mr maaten ' s report supports the commission proposal .
i hope you can reassure us of this in your conclusion .
you have done so modestly , and that is to your credit .
the time is up , i think .
i therefore ask quite specifically that we should think about scaling down the amount of administrative bureaucracy applied in this area .
the same applies to the importing of products from third countries .
here we are at the focal point of a dramatic and nullifying issue .
it works the same way in all democratic states .
debates on these areas have been held in this parliament for a great many years .
the historical model to return to in this case is the supreme soviet ' s democracy arrangements .
the clarification we seek serves the aim of securing legitimacy and transparency .
at the moment the main fears revolve around the liquidity crisis turning into an insolvency crisis .
yet we already regret certain weaknesses .
the community customs code will not be an obstacle to greater competitiveness .
that is to say , these questions have to remain within the competence of local authorities .
eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic .
this applies especially to medium and small enterprises .
secondly , protectionism with regard to certain finished products from south africa .
i see that the council is indeed concerned about this matter .
in certain regions of europe , fresh fish prices have fallen by an average of 25 % .
the council president does not have this right in this declaration .
we have decided on an economic strategy with five objectives ; not sixty , but five .
we have fallen into that trap too often .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , 6 july , at 12:00 .
after all , it also wants the support of our union .
the present situation is a flawed and inequitable market .
and i would also like our parliament itself to take its cue from the wise men ' s report .
in that context , it would be necessary to find a dual legal base to deal with both together .
greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future .
international law also obliges us to apply scientific criteria .
it is doubtful whether the present revision operation will be able to contribute to this aim .
we are not there yet , but we must not give up .
mexico is not a dictatorship , but a democracy .
however , these provisions extend only to ' community airports ' and ' community carriers ' .
mr president , first of all i would like to congratulate mrs larive on her work in producing this report .
the vote will take place on thursday .
public service broadcasting is not only being discussed in this report .
we should respect these different models .
there was therefore no failure to honour obligations .
this is important in the case of juvenile sole , as this species has a very high survival rate .
finally , i should like to mention the barnier report on the creation of europe aid .
it retains all its powers because it has resigned in the context of article 159 .
but to achieve this the union will have to do a great deal of work ; also in the internal market as well .
however , it also gives rise to a degree of inflexibility in the budget .
it is now important to see to it that the agreements enter into force as soon as possible .
we do not owe them solidarity .
however , mr monti , it was the least you could do .
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what brussels actually does ?
we therefore feel that reference to the application of the ' polluter pays ' principle is dangerous .
i should like to elaborate on a few key points .
commissioner , please clarify the commission 's position .
i believe we need more effective checks for contamination .
i shall give you three factors .
sustainable energy can give a boost to development .
these too are sad side effects of tourism that deserve our attention .
statements by the president
we do not want to tie your hands or hold you hostage .
on the other hand , your position in the commission also calls for optimism .
we shall now proceed to voting time .
here we have an awful lot to deliver and i think we should focus on that delivery .
the principle of analytical demonstrability in the end product has been abandoned .
the vast majority of the european parliament is an ally .
homophobia is there , in customs and traditions , in language , everywhere .
in my opinion , that ought to have been enough .
that is the answer to your first question .
and to do that , there is no other solution than to reduce obligatory contributions .
how do we establish our priorities in an enlarged union ?
each year hundreds of thousands of women are abused in the european sex industry .
ms. fiona hall 's excellent and comprehensive report also bears evidence to that .
you need to tell the council that we can not go on like this .
i firmly believe that they will bear fruit .
that statement has very often been heard in this house , and it is true all the same .
in the social arena above all , we , the european parliament , represent the driving force within the union .
thank you , mr coelho .
written statement ( rule 142 of the rules of procedure )
simplifying the lives of european citizens is one of the eu 's concerns .
these are binding clauses for the european union , and yet these clauses are systematically ignored .
there are two points at issue here : firstly , permit defence and secondly ' state of the art ' defence .
i also want to welcome the positive response from the commissioners .
that is why the ' euro crisis ' is bursting out all over .
the eu has promised to take the lead in implementing this management programme .
so i warn against using sham conflicts to bring about such a situation in this house .
that is something we are eminently familiar with , particularly in the border region from which i come .
however , unfortunately , that approach is still unfeasible at this stage ...
( b5 - 0210/2002 ) by mrs malmström and mrs thors , on behalf of the eldr group , on moldavia / moldova ;
in that respect , i think , mr   juncker , that you have made some good proposals .
madam president , this is not a very suitable subject to deal with through urgency .
that is not consonant with human dignity .
furthermore , as you know , algeria occupies an important position at the moment .
we need cleaner fuels and cleaner cars .
the swedish national contact point is the only one to consult trade unions proactively .
please excuse me for going on a little too long .
the ecr group has therefore voted against this report .
i very much wanted to mention this .
i believe that this will greatly benefit them and can also boost their returns .
( de ) mr president , human beings do not have crumple zones .
what will happen if such inadequate solutions are adopted ?
mr president , that has to change .
ensuring respect for human rights lies at the very heart of the united nations mission .
that in itself is a concrete result .
the joint debate is closed .
– mr president , we are talking about turkey joining europe .
thank you very much , commissioner silguy .
we need to launch , support and give practical form to a genuine mediterranean project .
mr rohde mentioned the example of china .
the flow of subsidies intended to promote freedom in that country is being cut off .
the union is dismally uninspiring .
the morgan report also calls for binding sectoral targets .
it was they who presided over it and got us into it .
when can we expect these two regulations to be passed ?
we have held tough negotiations and we have achieved many substantial improvements .
preparation for the european council of 16/17 june 1997
why is this decision so long in coming ?
we could do it at little more than the cost of business as usual .
thirty thousand children die of hunger and poverty - related illnesses a day .
however , i understand your call for more flexibility in order to facilitate crisis management .
the european union emphasises that the crisis can only be resolved through discussions .
none whatsoever .
that is the situation that you are being asked to accept or reject tomorrow .
women have been a wonderful addition to the workforce .
we often say , mr president , that we want to promote human rights in third countries .
mr president , i should like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for the work they have done .
the third element of our vision is improving democratic governance .
that leads to unnecessary delays .
that is the first answer .
i can therefore only warn the commission not to take these steps .
but i would certainly claim that they are better than the average in europe .
for eight consecutive years , gas production by gazprom has been stagnating at the same level .
that was the slogan of the time and i think it was a slogan we will surely all agree with .
i am thinking in particular of the smallest and newest member states .
everyone from the political groups and institutions knew that the liberal group had these objections .
the flames travelled 20   km in three hours .
i want to say that at the outset , because that praise is deserved .
if it is peaceful , there will be no problem .
it will eliminate the delays in implementing the fund 's aims .
clearly , mr cashman would have wanted to add his own opinion but could not be here today .
it is for that reason i decided to abstain from the final vote .
i should like , madam president , to say a few words about mr newman 's report .
data will be processed only for the purpose of terrorism .
the commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly .
tomorrow ’s vote will be a vote for the truth , ladies and gentlemen .
– ‘ - would it not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another ?
in the meantime , i understand that i need to speak further away from the microphone .
the quality is bound to suffer .
we have to put an end to this situation as soon as possible .
in the united kingdom , draconian measures have been introduced .
there will be a common economic policy and a common tax policy .
they constitute examples of good interinstitutional cooperation .
but i was , like others , a victim of the ash cloud .
nor ought the issue of oil to be forgotten .
is it just the merit of women that is being questioned ?
these are serious allegations .
if , like you , visitors come here , it is because they have chosen to come .
the euro info centres and the cooperation networks are more necessary than ever .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to comment on a few points .
hazard maps are lacking in many european countries and regions .
let us be honest : our ineffective and expensive strategy is tempting no one .
for that i want to thank you .
your support for the proposal is very important in achieving that result .
the president will be aware of your words from the most worthy source : from the minutes .
i would certainly have welcomed full participation by parliamentarians until the end of the summit .
( parliament rejected the motion . )
that is the virtue of integrated planning .
there is the right to demonstrate , which emanates clearly from freedom of expression .
this is one of the key points of europe 's neighbourhood and enlargement policies .
the recent gas crisis between russia and ukraine is already several months behind us .
this is especially true in respect of cancer prevention and cure .
i am glad that has been tackled .
i have seen children who will not survive beyond the age of 14 .
i can remember trying to dial 112 – the emergency number .
viewed from this angle , too , she is an outstanding candidate .
the debate is closed .
most problems are caused by traffic jams in towns .
i am thinking about five points in particular .
we all know that the internal market covers a multitude of subjects .
but we will have fewer people in brussels and more people in the field .
naturally , it has also been endorsed by the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
is there a clear cross - border dimension ?
you can not just put everything that was so carefully worked out in parliament on ice !
i should be grateful if you could give me a little more detail on that .
you have two minutes .
it is extremely important that we have uniform rules and uniform monitoring procedures .
today , it is crisis management and insurance schemes that are at issue .
when , in 1995 , sweden joined the eu , many swedes were sceptical .
or is it about mobile phones ?
i would urge it to abandon that measure : it has no place in the european union .
once again , we are doing the opposite of what should be done , and this is unfortunate for our children .
that is a great challenge and one in which mr petritsch deserves our full support .
the second main issue in the debate was energy .
this is a further trend that the report seeks to rectify , on its own terms .
therefore , progress is not always made in the direction we would like .
like others , i rejoice at the release of alan johnston .
many roma children are actually forced to attend special schools , if not institutions for the disabled .
i hope we can live up to that .
on one hand , you are referring to what has been said by the presidency and i am not going to insist on that .
we clarified the work to be done by turning to country - specific recommendations .
appropriate finances will then , of course , be required .
good accounts make good friends .
the reduction of community initiatives to just three is to be welcomed .
i should like to draw your attention to various points made in the corbett report .
at the moment , sadly , it is not .
however , the eu is still a long way from having a coherent civil foreign policy .
we therefore think we should focus on two essential aspects of this .
madam president , mr   schlyter , i have not said that the bank has decided to fund it .
this makes it an essential instrument in implementing the european security strategy .
that was also confirmed this week by the visit of wole soyinka , the winner of the nobel peace prize .
i note that there have been adjustments here too .
it is also a very definite political matter .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
that is where the care is provided in practice , at the micro level .
how can we fail to be outraged at this ?
it has been a colossal task , but extremely rewarding .
mr president , i find it hard to believe that nobody questions the need for this legislation .
elimination of poverty
you should at least have the decency to let our speaker deliver his address .
these communities are represented at institutional level .
europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage .
these people will not know their rights , not have legal representation .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 137(1 ) of the rules of procedure ) .
why are we not , for instance , opening up discussions and debate with iran at the present time ?
mr president , i wish to make three points .
thank you for your answer .
this objective remains one of the union 's priorities .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now perfectly clear that we must rebuild a european agricultural model .
i said this very clearly and that is why we are applying pressure .
at the same time , the policy must become a great deal more coherent .
i fully understand the meaning of the word competition , but it is also necessary ...
there is no need .
it is not true that the presidency was seeking to kill off the british rebate .
as such , i confirm my vote in favour .
that concludes this item .
these points were positive .
environmental pollution does not respect boundaries .
i was 10 years old , and i remember it well .
thank you , mr byrne .
but let us be frank .
why does the commission not prescribe any standards in this respect ?
policy at union level is not necessary and there is no basis for it in the treaty .
the eur 280 million that many have spoken about is just a drop in the ocean .
the civilian population are suffering yet again as a result of the destruction caused by this war .
on its website it goes a little further .
the turkish government must show the way .
we were discussing earlier in this forum how important that is .
clearly we have to be very concerned with the present situation .
this attempt had never been made before .
i was asked if the number of beneficiaries would be reviewed .
this situation , where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations , can not continue .
i said that quite clearly and i have said that many times before .
however , it really proves the point that iceland has close connections with the eu .
the cohesion fund may also support this work .
the olaf report painted a quite different picture .
this situation clearly requires both political and public responses .
it is all the more regrettable that there is an opt - out for two member states , namely the united kingdom and poland .
in conclusion , i would like to express my satisfaction with the report .
it is important that we do so , and it is important that we do so as quickly as possible .
our response is quite clear .
mr president , behaviour which is apparently irrational usually has an explanation .
that is particularly true after the adoption of important passages in the amsterdam draft treaty .
i will now come to the last point , the statute for political parties .
that is a reality .
mr   swoboda ’s speech on the issue of turkey was a wise one .
i am certain that we can also contribute to this with today 's debate .
dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama must definitely continue .
is it really for the benefit of the consumer ?
madam president , i wish mrs roth - behrendt a speedy recovery .
in this regard , collaboration with cedefop should be firmly endorsed .
that too is an important point for us .
( cs ) my original intention was to address an entirely different topic .
( the sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m. )
the issue of the protection of personal data is an important one for the european parliament .
there are two divergent opinions on this matter .
how all that will fit into this round is something i leave to you and your wisdom .
i should now like to discuss a variety of subjects , the first of which is agriculture .
i am not at all certain that parliament will go along with this .
we believe that is right .
the vote will take place on thursday , 5 june 2008 .
i should like to focus them still more specifically , mr president .
question no 4 is withdrawn
i hope that we can discuss the issue of licences in peace and quiet in the committee on human genetics .
4 . pharmacovigilance of medicinal products ( amendment of regulation ( ec ) no 726/2004 ) (
the costs of maintenance must not be reduced during the economic crisis , either .
that is of fundamental importance .
and that is mr bowe 's fear too .
what guarantees does the commission provide us in this area ?
the debate is closed .
on item ii , nuclear waste :
is there any threat to the date of 1 january ?
however , we only have gps on loan .
it is not clear what constitutes a large number .
the importance of governance at various levels deserves to be highlighted .
at the same time , let us be absolutely clear on this as well .
sixthly , i come to jamaica .
and plurality means the obligation to regulate the role of workers throughout the organisation .
we do not hear enough about this .
i believe that what still needs to be resolved is the problem of the chamber itself .
what do we have to be so pleased and proud about ?
and that is why we also need a monopoly .
they need to be simplified .
the question is : when will the commission draw conclusions from that data , during this term or later ?
solely on points like these the european union could deliver improvements .
what are the effects of electromagnetic waves on the human body ?
the way in which this report has been adopted is appalling .
it is only for that reason that the commission does not believe it is necessary to mention this aspect .
let us cope with the situation .
i admire all the honourable members with so much time to surf the net .
it does not want to solve the waste problem , it wants to burn it !
mr cox has the floor for a point of order .
the final text can be deemed a pleasing and balanced compromise .
hundreds of thousands of young people - the intelligentsia - are leaving the country .
we were in fact the only people arguing for dollarisation of the budget .
the time available does not allow me to say too much , prime minister .
one point is that we do not yet have a common fisheries policy .
this resolution is a step forward in reaffirming these values .
thank you very much , mr prodi .
mr president , i would like to put forward an oral amendment .
there are many good things in the report which pursue this aim .
we promised them that we would lead them out of their economic isolation .
this too seems to us to be essential for the purposes of managing industrial change .
the european voice and the european effort are not being maximized .
we can not permit the creation of new spheres of influence in europe .
there are problems in practice , however .
. ( fr ) we have refused to validate the results of the european council in thessaloniki .
i voted in favour of the cites convention report .
what is the best way to do this ?
the commission can not accept amendments 1 , 7 , 9 , 15 or 16 .
that could be very expensive and very impractical .
they would have faced a lot of red tape when their credit limit changed .
i can not agree with the previous speaker that some kind of force is involved here .
the head of echo 's africa unit visited the region from 30 january to 1 february .
we have had very good experience of this dialogue and we think that it works well .
would it be a million , 10 million or even 100 million ?
i warmly welcome my two colleagues ' reports .
all this against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis and high unemployment .
this is not justified either , which is what the report attempts to do in technical terms .
i have also received the same notice as mr mcmahon and i agree with him fully .
in particular we must bring china and india on board to force the change .
in all likelihood , this would trigger a real crisis of legitimacy for the european union .
this goes to show just how topical this subject is .
subject : employment guidelines 1998 - women 's employability
i would add that the gas market should be allowed a certain amount of time in which to develop .
budget neutrality is now but another eu promise whistling in the wind .
i hope the new commission will put forward some proposals in this area .
they must make much more efficient and more consistent use of rapex .
what we have said is that it is not possible to establish who the winner is .
those questions need to be answered urgently and clearly .
that is not our aim .
as a first step on the way to resolving this problem , the report is very useful .
my own doubts about this have not been dispelled , either .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
there is good cause for the balkans to be regarded as one of the most explosive points on the planet .
i should therefore be grateful if the minutes could be amended accordingly .
how do we want to establish the dialogue between the afghan and the pakistani governments ?
as the directive stands at the moment , it produces nothing .
i would like to ask whether the bureau intends to introduce variable voting times .
on that issue i wish to say the following .
mr mulder 's report contains many important provisions in that regard .
this list is unfortunately far from exhaustive .
the commission has to stick to the instruments it has been given .
i got used to it during the british presidency .
with that in mind , i think that this ought to be our fundamental approach to the subject .
this , however , is a term that can be interpreted in many ways .
in that case , however , i do not think that parliament will be on your side .
now the same is true with the albania situation .
i believe that my country should withdraw from the eu 's social chapter .
it might even backfire .
i voted in favour of this report .
indeed , mr collins assured me that this has nothing to do with nato membership .
at that point we were all united , and i hope we are in this case as well .
the debate is closed .
thanks to the directive , one of the most significant employee rights will be consolidated .
we must remain credible .
we know that it will not happen soon , but we want to help you with this .
what was wrong with the policies of member states and the eu institutions ?
it is therefore unlikely that the meeting can be organised before june at the earliest .
agenda of the next sitting : see minutes
it will affect their whole lives in future .
if this were to be recognised in the eu , she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her .
( the sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. )
i think it is important now that we give leadership to europe .
these causes are generally forgotten .
the commission also finances actions which directly address the issue .
the vote will take place at the february i part - session .
for various reasons , this statute did not enter into force in this form until 8 october 2004 .
the population in the north was artificially increased and that in the south artificially reduced .
we want to improve road safety .
however , i can not support the proposal because of the amended legal basis .
no priority has been defined .
we are expecting definite intervention from the eu .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by ...
the questions are specific , detailed and relevant .
we managed it in mostar , so why not in other cities ?
mr president , the future presents both threats and opportunities .
it may be that some members will agree with the proposal to reject it .
that is the case in catalonia and , i would say , in all the catalan regions .
vice - president of the commission . - i think that this particular question is quite difficult .
we are fully aware of the urgency of this matter .
today 's debate is a perfect example .
there is no other sensible option .
i will take no points of order and we shall move directly to the vote .
written statements ( rule 149 )
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .
subject : ban on visiting cuban nationals imprisoned in the united states
i welcome the vote on this resolution .
the inclusion of primary schools is , i think , justified for many reasons .
we are waiting for results .
i do not know whether it is for a motion of procedure or for a personal reason , but i noticed that he reacted very strongly .
is this just the fault of individual member states ?
the debate is closed .
thank you very much , mr president .
you do not come to this nomination through any defining electoral process .
will we simply let this happen ?
however , we must not make unrealistic demands here .
let us not forget that .
question no 5 by josé salafranca sánchez - neyra ( h-0853/98 )
verification of credentials : see minutes
my group will therefore be voting against mentioning this principle .
i do not think so .
he did not persuade us .
and in that street you can see the moros y cristianos festival being prepared .
mr president , i venture to describe mr schröder 's report as excellent .
subsidiarité oblige !
i do not think that we can just leave this decision to industry alone .
they sleep in the corridors because there are not enough cells there .
if we do not do that , we will lose .
what the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes , not the underlying trends .
who cares that there are hardly any young beekeepers to take over ?
finally , the european parliament must have an increased role .
i hope he will support mrs seillier 's two amendments .
the theme of ireland 's presidency was ' europeans working together ' .
secondly , we are currently adopting growth and rescue packages all over europe .
in politics , responsibilities may be accepted , above all , when they are taken up .
that is something on which my colleague , commissioner monti , and i both agree .
ahlqvist report ( a4 - 0200/97 )
it is a resource which must be shared .
that is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first .
( the sitting was suspended at 11.36 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
this was successful .
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?
however , there should only be the one system , meeting both environmental and social requirements .
however , by law we mean community law or member state law .
what kind of example is this setting the new member states ?
that will be done .
second , there is the need for further community actions .
those are not audited .
that , moreover , is an aspect i am keen to emphasise .
thank you very much , commissioner .
several member states fundamentally oppose it .
we are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands .
there is an urgent need to alter this trend .
i would like you , with your great experience , to be involved in this profound change .
what we are experiencing today is not however in line with that approach .
emissions trading must be improved .
the debate is closed .
as they say , rome was not built in a day .
the reality of course is rather different .
it is the voice of those who give life and who are committed to preserving it .
mr president , violence against women is not a private issue .
i followed this up with a letter to him this week .
it is brilliant news for us .
the convention should reflect upon these issues .
that is why the top priority is for us to act jointly on the world stage through the european union .
question no 5 by francisca sauquillo pérez del arco ( h-0179/02 ) :
i would , however , like to give my personal interpretation of your programme , and ask three fundamental questions .
this evidence must then be provided before the product can come onto the market .
this is the case at the moment .
i believe that clarity is lacking .
i hope to present the report in october .
member states therefore have to do something about it .
can the commission suggest any initiative in this direction ?
we will be watching very closely .
again , i thank you for your support .
i find that incredibly interesting .
barriers in these areas have been in place in the japanese market for decades .
dumping prices increase demand for energy and lead to it being wasted .
we need more and better europe .
it is our ambition to celebrate as little as possible but to work all the harder .
this has to be a concerted effort .
to crown it all , the national parliaments have been sidelined completely .
it does not meet the requirements of transparency and good administrative practice .
documents received : see minutes
there is a second issue , however .
officers of lower rank and fascist gangs of bullies favour the persecution .
we therefore support the onesta report and would like to thank you once more for your constructive cooperation .
, draftsman of the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her report .
but we need individual accountability as many speakers have said .
my long - term vision for these three areas is really quite uncomplicated .
membership of parliament : see minutes
that is where our role as the european parliament lies .
but the source is threatening to run dry .
the commission warns against complacency , and rightly so .
i believe it was important to reiterate those principles .
he was a member of the delegation for relations with japan .
( explanation of vote cut short pursuant to rule 137(1 ) of the rules of procedure )
efficiency is now a priority for our energy and climate change policy .
there are currently 48 least developed countries ( ldcs ) , which means that every fifth country in the world falls into this category .
we have had the first round of elections , which remain a matter of dispute .
( fi ) mr president , i would like to emphasise the importance of training .
this situation is very disturbing and requires an explanation .
the development of a common asylum and immigration policy forms an integral part of this .
here we have a different lever .
the debate is closed .
unfortunately , the text contains provisions which are unacceptable from the perspective of religious doctrine .
we await your courageous and innovative proposals , commissioner .
this proposal is quite specific .
i hope that this aspect will also be satisfied soon during the implementation of the stockholm programme .
i believe that mrs roithová put it very succinctly in her speech .
the resolution places too much of the responsibility on the eu .
nevertheless , we must keep making progress in this area .
european environmental economic accounts ( debate )
our institutions must strengthen one another for the sake of the european project .
member of the commission .
that is all i have to say , madam president .
21 . a european initiative for the development of micro - credit in support of growth and employment (
decisions concerning certain documents : see minutes
as far as the report of the wise men is concerned , it is , by definition , a matter for them alone .
we would then get far more results .
we have been told that it was not a nato vessel , that it was not the charles de gaulle .
we must not expect too much of reports on human rights , even of those originating from this house .
that is what it is primarily about ; that is what it is primarily intended to do .
the treaty of amsterdam enables us to do this .
she urged all catholics not to be deterred by this murder .
but what can we do ?
other towns and cities in the uk are pursuing similar initiatives .
mr president , i thank the rapporteur for his work in this area .
we have no alternative but to keep on believing in oslo - putting our trust in oslo .
does that mean , however , that other persecutions were perhaps less serious ?
this also applies to europe in international relations .
the middle east has been no exception .
the proposals have been made ; it all depends on the european party statute .
small steps are often , in practice , the most important ones .
we know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable .
iraq must and shall comply with the demands made by the security council .
i very much regret that the united states has voted against .
that is a prerequisite and an imperative for democracy .
seventhly , land management and planning are the responsibility of each member state .
mr president , what message do europeans have for our almost 18 million unemployed people ?
that is why i voted as i did .
madam president , i supported this report .
i do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .
the european parliament has shown courage .
the commission finds 20 of these amendments acceptable in full or in part .
i can not take this step , however .
there is still a great deal to be done in chernobyl .
mr president , baroness ashton , i would also like to thank you for your statement .
he is still in prison .
this is the first time , it is the first exercise .
everything else must come later and contribute to that .
lastly , it is correct that no new anti - dumping investigations were initiated in the first half of 2007 .
this brave vision must be expanded to include even more justice .
we are being promised cures to many diseases .
it is intended that concrete measures be in place very shortly after that .
nevertheless , no one actually disputes his victory .
we are calling ourselves into question and , in my opinion , we can not allow this to happen .
there was absolutely no reason to cut short the debate .
president mugabe and his cronies have wrecked a once prosperous and once stable country .
what , at long last , is to be done ?
these should show the extent to which the power plants are capable of withstanding similar disasters .
when are you going to produce an action plan for reducing staff numbers ?
we therefore support the first turco report , as tabled in committee .
we should like to believe that the council is listening and responding to them .
i have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 37(2 ) of the rules of procedure .
this sunday , 9 may , is the 60th anniversary of the schumann declaration .
the increased cost of fuel leads to higher operating costs .
we should also drop the principle of equal rotation .
many thanks , mr president .
the european commission needs to table proposals fast .
my choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility .
that is why we are fighting for it so much .
we need each other on this level too .
in 1986 , the who launched a world - wide programme to combat aids .
of course , a codex of this nature has to be put into practice .
the benefits of the 2004 enlargement are clear to the europe of 25 .
already , the first italian and additional french troops have been deployed .
in the report , the rapporteur , mrs svensson , makes points with which i agree .
we need to think , however , about what sort of cars we travel in .
what measures will it propose to ensure that these circumstances are not repeated in the future ?
in addition to the horrific nature of the matter , violence against women is also expensive .
confusing these notions would generate new and unnecessary misunderstandings .
since 2005 , several ertms equipped lines have been put into service .
how can we tackle this problem ?
this is highly creditable .
however , these reports have now been superseded by completely new facts .
if we increase the penalty , then we see the price rise .
however , the time factor also has to be taken into account , of course .
we no longer had our own flag or national anthem , and our capital city was moscow .
what are the geographical limits of europe ?
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen , could it get any worse ?
we must not overdo it , however , ladies and gentlemen .
pressure is being exerted from two sides .
there seems to be a high degree of consensus on the need for reform .
the consultation received a polarised response .
for the first time , you are president of the commission of the enlarged community .
it is a tax on trade rather than on profits .
i am convinced that this is a decisive factor with regard to the environment .
the document also duplicates the world health organisation 's similar plan .
there is one final question : who will be able to benefit from these data and how ?
thank you commissioner wulf - mathies .
this will blow fresh air and bring transparency into the offices of the commission .
when is russia going to stop threatening human rights activists ?
but europe must avoid talk of the dimensions of empire .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , over the last few months , a growing number of sudden decisions has been taken to make mass redundancies or to close down companies ' sites .
or , as it says in paragraph 12 of the resolution , is it the ' major player ' ?
they can not , therefore , be a full substitute for a charging regime .
i voted in favour of the morgan report on european energy strategy .
what is more , from a personal point of view , he knows we think fondly of him .
however , i will be more than happy to react in writing to the question that you have just put .
the costs have to be paid out of the public purse .
what is lacking , is the political will to provide the necessary funding .
that just goes to show the possibilities in our country !
i just want everybody here to know that this is a pure lie .
these harmful traditional practices affect many girls and women in europe on a daily basis .
there are no clues .
in fact , i can not understand how the commission can back the council proposal .
could you please explain what that was ?
it is not just an issue of whether or not we are using ngos .
probably in the family environment .
mobility is a value contributing to the benefit of the whole european economy .
we must devote every effort to the task of nurturing and encouraging ukraine 's democratic gains .
i think it important that these roles are seen as a whole .
mrs oomen - ruijten and mrs jackson raised a point about indirect advertising .
they began on 15 march 1995 , and the agreement was initialled in july the same year .
there were critical remarks , which we all heard .
i am going to be watching the process very carefully .
i have myself benefited from both of them .
( parliament rejected the request to refer the matter back to committee )
eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .
this is a small step towards a major objective .
the sri lankan government or anonymous witnesses ?
that indeed is the motion that is contained in the report .
the un register for conventional weapons should be opened to this category of weapons .
one is to further develop the agenda for an enlarged european union .
this is an area in which it has a leadership role , one that it must actually play .
how are the negotiations going for the eu regarding our own top domain name ?
of course , again , there is no specific target date .
this is shameful , and i refuse to go along with it !
so use them , for god 's sake !
here we need more than monitoring .
closing of the session
in europe , one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime .
finally , on a point of order , genuinely a point of order .
the next item is questions to the council ( b4 - 0017/98 ) .
when ?
so what you need is an effective treaty , a treaty of clear values - and you have got it .
in my group we are against the inequalities between the north and the south .
the debate is closed .
( the president cut off the speaker )
it is possible to establish and implement democratic regimes in these regions .
firstly , it is not easy to delimit crisis situations precisely .
the right course of action is to decide on priority actions and objectives .
we do not want to interfere in the affairs of member states .
the use of peat is a bonus in nordic energy policy .
we should exchange pnr , but that should not be done without rules .
already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the european producer .
we await an explanation .
our own goal must be to end discrimination and safeguard their rights .
we expect the money to be allocated to specific purposes when it is paid out .
my group is very happy to support the report as it stands .
we say we are united in diversity , so let us cooperate .
we must increase the take - up rate of the structural funds .
i am of course referring to the legislation on european committees .
ahead of us lie a number of difficult years , without doubt .
i think this is the last possibility or opportunity that i will have to say thank you to you .
i take good note of your comment , and the correction you wish will be made .
hence there can not be religious conflict .
people are being driven out , being forced from their homes and killed .
the treaty of nice is actually in the main about something else .
mr president , i just wish to comment briefly on some of the debate .
at the end of 2008 , the european parliament took up this matter , too , in a resolution .
( lt ) without a doubt , i am not satisfied with that reply .
i hope that we shall together unanimously document this tomorrow .
i respect your position on morocco , but i do not share it .
the vanity of the west is evident .
the political environment is challenging .
it is important to break the culture of impunity about such killings and to put an end to them .
i would also like to ensure that we in europe do not lose out if we say no .
that is why i voted as i did .
this , for me , is a major concern . mrs   scheele put it well : it is a question of political will .
what we need , of course , is the lisbon agenda , not the lisbon treaty .
so too does mr goebbels ' report , even if the part about sweden is limited .
secondly , i should like to emphasise training organisations or training on the job .
these are two very different concepts .
i hope that it is a procedural motion .
as you can imagine this caused consternation in the house .
we really have to because the situation in iran is gravely problematic and dramatic .
the european union itself should be a little more consistent .
we similarly have responsibilities in other continents .
even though the report does not live up to our expectations in all respects , we shall vote in favour .
also , the seriousness of the tobacco issue is of a completely different order from that of alcohol .
first , that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities .
last but not least , the price of compound feedingstuff in animal feeds should become cheaper .
it has nothing to do with islam or the koran .
subject : dramatic decline in the income of cotton producers in greece
this would undermine the current system whereby the member states own the treaties .
we do not want duplication within the different institutions in terms of what we do .
you have said , mrs rodríguez ramos , that you can not bring yourself to oppose the objectives of reform , and that is quite something .
we have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the f - gas industry .
in our view serbia is part of it .
this parliament will have to give its opinion on this overview .
only thus can it work properly .
fight the fire in the winter and not in the summer , when it is already raging .
it follows that the european constitution is also irrelevant , as well as dead !
that is a recipe for disaster and even a recipe for armed conflict .
he has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances .
mr president , i simply wanted to make a brief comment on the amendments .
this should be questioned .
and i hope the european parliament will support this proposal .
the opening up of markets , carried out if possible in the image of the eu single market , is the objective .
i know that in the political process law is frequently considered irritating .
we are dealing here with a debate in which you have heard mr parish expressing a great deal of anger .
we have not yet been able to draw the final conclusion as to whether it is a matter for the national competition authority or the commission in brussels . as soon as that has been decided , you will be informed .
otherwise , if we do not bear this in mind , our countryside will sooner or later become just an agricultural museum .
most of these funds came from the chinese diaspora living in different parts of the world .
( the sitting closed at 16:35 )
i repeat . mr tőkés got 334 votes .
this also gave a tremendous boost to the millennium development objectives that were subsequently formulated .
we have to assume responsibility here , today , in the present .
is this the economic development model that europe should be proposing to europeans ?
it also has to deal with :
we consider this kind of proposal to be a red herring .
yet here they are in our own building .
this is a very important topic .
otherwise , the democratic deficit will , unfortunately , become wider .
there are no visions or specific statements of intent for the next 10 to 15 years .
this is a serious error , the correction of which is important .
these regulations lie at the heart of the common fisheries policy .
on the contrary , we will pay a hefty price for all our efforts .
un , unicef and wfp reports talk of a desperate situation .
but we are in europe , and we must speak about europe .
complementarity on development cooperation policies
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
nothing that happened earlier this month can change the geography of kosovo .
what exactly will be the reply ?
it is not only excellent in quality but also extremely useful .
more than half of this number - 22 million - are romanians .
it should not be the case that the policy of the member states contravenes that of the commission .
question no 48 by ( h-0677/99 ) :
mr verheugen , i would invite you to reply to mr watts ' question .
another aspect of the common fisheries policy is the protection of aquatic resources .
during my time as budget rapporteur a year ago , i observed that we were in practice concerned with three priorities . the first of these was the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement , which was less certain then than it is now .
it was misguided , however .
on the question of timing , we have a number of amendments .
be clear and precise in your promises and honour them .
it is up to you .
it is also absolutely essential to start the progress of this through the council .
this question is entirely rhetorical .
even the mainstream parties have adapted their language to the language spoken by extremists .
this buck - passing game has to stop !
we experienced that in rome .
we urgently need a different europe : a europe based on democracy and social progress .
it is doubtful whether this happened in the case of levi strauss .
( the sitting was closed at 12.00 noon )
the new rules remedy this shortcoming .
thirdly , mrs miguélez ramos , your report calls for the introduction of licence fees .
first essential point , deadlines .
it is therefore not a case of us imposing our western standards .
i do not accept that . someone said that europe did not like or was not helping developing countries .
let this statistic be food for thought for all of us .
that is the only reason .
the question is , then , what purpose that modernisation serves .
the commission 's files from that time are sufficient to show that this was not the case .
i am talking about latvia .
i ask you to work hard for this .
the second instrument concerns rural development .
what is necessary , above all , is the courage to critically examine the policies of the union so far .
like him , i would like some serious proposals from the commission .
that is my experience , at least .
the last question , honourable members , is one we must ask of ourselves .
however , there is another debate which needs to be held .
i found this an interesting two - and - a - half - hour debate on the challenges which lie ahead of us .
what do we expect from terrorists ?
yet in europe these rules are nowhere to be seen !
other council constellations are also holding public debates .
development and economic growth currently underpin the proper functioning of a country .
there is no real reason for the state to be involved .
how else can we move towards more sustainable production and consumption practices ?
we must not deprive belarus of all the delights generated by the market .
for years , a brutal junta has been terrorising the people of burma , who live in extreme poverty .
i want to stress this point once again .
the basic problem is and remains : social state or liberal state ?
the debate is closed .
i would like to emphasise the remarkable economic progress which has been made by taiwan .
it should not be too difficult to reach an overall agreement on this .
( in successive ballots the following were elected quaestors of the european parliament :
i would just like to say a few words about eurobonds .
service is declining in those cases , therefore .
i am completely in agreement with taking this approach .
what does the council intend to do to raise standards in this area as soon as possible ?
the years of violence have affected several generations .
( nl ) neighbours look after one another , they support each other .
the new treaty contains 105 new powers for the eu - just like the constitution .
they will need to play an exemplary role .
in the end , we are all members of minorities .
our budget is already under considerable strain .
ultimately , it is undermining europe 's political identity .
it puts us back where we started .
that is why programmes which promote growth and employment are very important .
have a nice lunch !
this sometimes seems as if we are battering our heads against the kremlin wall in the way we used to do .
we think that the company 's behaviour is unacceptable .
yet , there are good ideas .
if you are part of a country , i think you have rights and duties .
let me just mention three reasons why we think a new treaty is needed .
hypocrisy can not be condoned though .
( nl ) the follow - up conference on climate change in bonn produced two extremes .
many of them , as those figures show , are children .
this house has for years supported all these organisations ; it even founded some of them .
it needs to consolidate the implementation of the ongoing judicial reforms .
we did so out of respect for the verdict the irish people were to give .
there are two points on which i would appreciate a straightforward answer from the commission .
so how and what do we decide ?
rod report ( a5 - 0412/2001 )
this proposal provides a framework for addressing issues relating to detergents , as and when they arise .
that is why i would like to ask for support for the european charter here in parliament as well .
but at a social level , technology is never neutral .
our society is undergoing huge changes , and that is what worries people .
could you promise that you will come up with a proposal shortly ?
i have to say that a conciliation is actually fought with very unequal weapons .
he is calling on other members , mr president , china and russia .
first of all , i have to say that experts are extremely useful .
the debate is closed .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
are the data on which these developments are based even meaningful ?
thank you , mr fischbach , for having dispensed social harmony on such a gigantic scale .
2 . situation in the democratic republic of congo and rape as a war crime ( debate )
the funding will pay for electoral equipment and the printing of ballot papers .
thank you for your speech , mr farage .
this is not a new phenomenon , and it does not only concern germany .
it will not work like that .
the debate is closed .
we shall adjourn the debate at this point because of question time .
you know that in my country the debate is becoming heated .
i am not arguing that we should abandon the demand for budgetary restrictions .
indeed the dream that should drive us is the dream of reuniting europe .
it has been the presidency 's intention to treat the prestige accident extremely seriously .
the action taken by the government has gained recognition in international markets .
i also welcome the comments made by the commission president , mr prodi .
the facts are relatively straightforward .
i would be in favour of developing a special relationship with turkey .
we shall now proceed to the vote on the request to defer the debate .
i think that semi - solutions such as carbon storage can not be a solution for the future .
what is economic governance ?
council question time
it might be because of former colonial ties . there might be a language link .
madam president , the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly can discuss any subject .
in particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
that is why we wanted to postpone voting on the resolution until the september part - session .
the next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions :
these will rise to eur   112   billion by the end of this year .
i shall start with a short announcement .
hence the reference to standards , to allow you to make comparisons .
i am convinced that my own country , sweden , would also find the exercise very valuable .
education can not just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness .
east timor and indonesia
thank you very much , mr de silguy .
the groups will negotiate the content of the resolution .
i think that is perfectly reasonable .
a duty of information also lies with the american government .
firstly , it is not good for people to become addicted to drugs .
this is very regrettable .
can we not do better ?
alejo vidal - quadras : 300 votes
for 1992 , six budget years ago , this figure was about 1.20 % as a maximum spending limit .
the vending machines – which are the main issue – can be adjusted .
i am sure mrs villiers dislikes fraud as much as the commission .
10 . special measure 2007 for iraq ( vote )
it is also extremely detailed .
is there already a timetable for this and do we already have any ideas of what we will do ?
however , there is still a great deal to be done in the area of intellectual property .
i am a federalist but i am not a centralist .
we have held talks with the groups and have found that there is considerable backing for this proposal .
the question of whether gmos are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today 's debate .
we stand ready to help in any way the peace process .
we were given that assurance .
seventh : barriers to the free movement of students and teachers .
new procedures have been introduced into customs legislation for the purpose of guaranteeing security and safety .
before the project can start , we must make sure that the project meets stringent environmental criteria .
i think that this is very important .
transport problems provide an easy excuse .
i would like to point out one thing as a footnote to her statement .
this is fine , even if , as always , it was done too late .
the council is , by nature , a body that listens , considers and tries to provide answers .
this is a formally recognised organ of the world health organization .
consultation on the subject of the future treaty must take place in all the member states .
in short , prompt aid in macedonia is needed , both materially and politically .
information on fuel economy in new cars
for this reason i ask for a vote to be taken again on amendment no 8 .
that is what i actually stated .
that is why the situation only applies to new staff .
yet the report is a small step in the right direction .
firstly , we are concerned about the implications of the ak party case before the court .
we do not accept that single - minded austerity is the way out .
subject : proposed eu - south africa free trade agreement
mr president , commissioner , i shall deal specifically with the collins report .
we , the members of the quartet , are all clear on that .
( de ) madam president , the wellbeing of patients is key here .
members of this house are perfectly entitled to defend themselves against slanders of that sort .
protocol no . 9 makes explicit provision for the ecopoint system to be reviewed in 2001 .
it is taking place because a transitional period has just come to an end in spain and portugal .
the future cap must be understandable to farmers , but also to taxpayers .
up to 75 % of all metallic components in new vehicles can be recycled as metal scrap .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon .
we need a strategy .
we also know that it is impossible to react appropriately at national level .
this is the case in particular for access to documents in infringement procedures .
but let us not be under any illusions .
i trust that state aid reform will meet such requirements .
are we forecasting a slump , yes or no ?
they compromise the initial balance too severely .
that is not the case .
the ema has a vital role as the preferred source of objective information .
my group will therefore vote against some passages but support the report as a whole .
despite this , it was once again possible to reach agreement with the council .
( sv ) it is , in actual fact , astonishing that we are forced to have this debate .
the sea has long been regarded as the source of an inexhaustible food supply .
however , communication also involves truth and clarity .
this is something that will become more and more important in the coming days .
those are all elements that should be factored in .
this is , i think , totally unacceptable .
today we consume more than twice as much honey as we produce .
there were peaceful protests in all parts of the eu .
the debate is closed .
the eu 's rural areas are extremely diverse .
finally , they aspire to the proclamation of a true and genuine independent state .
i will gladly provide more detailed information on that , mr commissioner .
that is what we are advocating , pure and simple .
maybe this would have been easier , but we have passed that stage .
president - in - office of the council .
that is something for which we are directly responsible .
in communication terms , we should also highlight the reinforced capacity to act in the international scene .
we need an analysis of the situation as a whole from the commission .
hundreds have already been killed , and thousands are fleeing .
here we are in agreement with the commission and the council .
it is a parliamentary democracy , it is member of nato , it is a regional power .
the debate is closed .
( parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
this was also its main task .
that is why i voted as i did .
( loud applause ) ( the formal sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. )
we say that the state of israel is a democratic country .
the world bank has recently published information on the consequences of the attacks on new york for developing countries .
perhaps we can clarify the matters that are of special interest to you in a moment .
question no 60 by antonios trakatellis ( h-0026/99 )
everyone must take part , and that includes private citizens .
good administration needs to be clear and systematic , and that applies to parliament also .
now we see of course where the crown has gone !
will you make real demands ?
in fairness , the report is acceptable to all the political groups .
the three reports on e - learning by messrs mauro , perry and alavanos are excellent .
the vote will take place tomorrow , at 12   noon .
culture and education are intrinsically valuable in themselves .
i deplore it , but it is a fact .
question no 26 by paulo casaca ( h-0254/03 ) :
nothing of the sort exists in the former communist countries , and that is something they will have to develop .
thank you , president - in - office , i will pass on this answer to my party colleague , sören wibe .
it would be very radical to try to ban a certain plant .
we must all react – the european parliament , the commission and the council .
we will not support any further watering - down of the report .
i hope to see this translated into effective legislative measures by the commission .
china is as close to us now as were the totalitarian regimes before the second world war .
asking for asylum is not a crime , and should not be treated as such .
nevertheless , we would like to ask here for clarification on two points .
no such allegation should ever be made in a member state of the european union .
twice this request has been refused , contrary to the rules of procedure .
what is the question before us today ?
if you have any doubts about what has taken place , you can come to me about it .
from this perspective i feel that my conscience is clear .
we believe that the eu should have a common asylum and immigration policy .
do we already have a plan to work with ?
it is shameful that such programmes have to be funded by events on television .
at least two things are therefore necessary .
we can not support a military intervention against iraq .
we failed to carry out the reforms .
europe 's energy security is based on a variety of sources , routes and supply countries .
please do not let your countries send waste to dounreay .
i must reiterate how important it is to have information and consultation .
therefore this is a major breakthrough in the dispute .
at the same time , such agencies are growing in importance all around europe .
however , with your proposals , you have spun your car off the road .
personally , i am very much counting on it , because there is , all the same , a logic to this .
almost 20 000 workers may become unemployed .
we , the legislators , must ensure that the efforts of citizens are not in vain .
these tobacco products are most certainly and without any doubt harmful to health .
that is why i ask my colleagues and you to vote for this oral amendment .
i would agree with some of the remarks made by mrs schörling .
welcome as they are , words are not enough .
all of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e - mail .
the debate is closed .
this is most regrettable , given that your commission is intrinsically a good one .
however , this is a process that we are talking about .
mr president , i have three observations to make .
i would call on the commission to submit proposals to this effect too .
unfortunately , these systems are not yet standard vehicle components .
it is currently merely a european parliament wish list , with no obligation .
the second question was addressed to the commission by lord inglewood .
this is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal .
now that inhibits , i am sure you will agree , free movement .
europe must cease to turn a blind eye .
are there any comments on the minutes ?
i can not predict whether or not the wye plantation agreements will be implemented .
an issue was raised about the cost .
this is happening against a background of high unemployment .
for that reason , this study must be examined now and not later .
that is simply too many people .
the reason my group wants to reject recital a is very simple .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
the major problems still remain unsolved .
cop 9 will help to ensure this .
the first of these is money .
in this context , the media have , recently , also been writing about tibet .
those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .
so it was essential that we put some amendment in .
however , i would also like to point to the pilot projects that we initiated .
unilateral action by the eu will prove fruitless .
( the president interrupts the orator )
i am not happy with it because i do not think it is clear enough .
we need new and current statistical data in this regard .
that is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report .
is this correct in this case , or what is the situation ?
i would agree with a lot of what has been said during this short debate .
i would ask that this be communicated to the bureau because something needs to be done about it .
the killing of a child in its mother ’s womb is not a human right .
i will begin by thanking the president - in - office for her answer .
monopolies and duopolies have been dissolved to the benefit of consumers and users , which is important .
gaza has been bombed to bits and israel is not allowing it to be rebuilt .
mr president , there are two points that i want to make .
sometimes the expected cofinancing did not materialize .
- attwooll report
that is all i wanted to say , thank you .
in any case , i think that 5 % is too high a threshold .
it is now madder than ever .
the commission 's lack of ambition reflects its own imbalanced policy perspective .
what is essential as far as the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party is concerned is political accountability .
we think that this is good for europeans - that it is good for our citizens .
i have to say , i have some qualms on the matter .
we must , then deal with this issue at the negotiating table .
i believe that it was mr barzanti who insisted on this point just now .
unfortunately i have to say that i am not impressed by the work of the eu so far .
i strongly believe that this will increase the rate of use of these funds .
on the contrary , the commission considers that the court of justice does not pass sentence quickly enough .
the material destruction will make itself felt in everyday life for a long time to come .
this criticism does of course not mean that entry into emu should be free of conditions .
the situation in the mediterranean is not primarily a border control problem .
we need clarity in this area .
i am quite happy to do that .
we will try to give you an answer when we can .
not in 2011 , not in 2012 , but in 2013 , when we have the possibility to do so .
i think that , at present , the european union is just like a gothic cathedral .
the commission failed to provide a financial impact assessment .
and our dependency stands at 75 % .
i therefore voted in favour .
where there is a will , there is a way .
it is mentioned in all eu documents .
finally , a word on the compensation fund for oil pollution .
i voted for this resolution .
the rothley report is today being submitted to us once again .
none of us is on the breadline yet !
in writing . - consumer credits are an essential pillar of the internal market .
topical and urgent debate
it is these objectives that an attempt has today been made to undermine .
it is therefore a problem that the commission should solve under the aegis of the wto .
it is one correct way forward .
why is there such resistance to its inclusion ?
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
no one will be able to accept advantages being accorded to chinese enterprises .
we can only encourage .
at the same time , it is 100 years since we had national markets that were closed .
more resources must be set aside to monitor government aid .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
we are not a record which you play over and over again .
millions of people have lost their jobs .
this region can find a solution as a region .
hopefully we will be able to continue to help it develop .
therefore , we all need to make a commitment to convince the people and to bring them with us when the time comes .
but at the same time , i am of the opinion that the council should also be here today .
are there any comments ?
the text also establishes satisfactory governance of the programmes .
i only have this country and i can not vote . '
do you know who else uses this argument ?
that is to say , we are concerned today not with cultural but with economic measures .
8 . space and security (
i do not want to make any more comments on that subject .
we must give this aid , and quickly , to all those persons affected .
there are not .
the other parties are not paying .
this is not for political reasons , but because of technical limitations .
we improved the proposal in the committee on transport and tourism .
i have to say i was quite amazed to read that here .
at the same time , we are creating a european stability mechanism safety net .
after all , it must be our objective for nuclear power stations to have the highest possible safety standards .
we should endeavour to strike that balance here .
transgenic maize is a time bomb as far as consumers and environmental protection are concerned .
they can do this purely to avoid criminal sanctions .
i would also like to thank the commission , particularly commissioner liikanen .
this will impair the effectiveness of the grubbing up regulation .
modernising social protection
amongst other things because , if i did , it would be a comparative advantage .
in this respect the eu has been a total success .
i object to the target group being widened .
we should , therefore , bear in mind some aspects that should not be forgotten :
these are not very helpful .
so i think it should not be included as a part of the agreement .
my own personal opinion is that we do not need nuclear energy .
fortunately those are now more or less a thing of the past .
recently , in this very house , indigenous mapuches from chile defended this very notion , diversity .
that will now be secured once and for all with this proposal .
that must not be the fate of the european maritime policy .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
he is right to suggest that it would not be very popular .
the feira summit is my last example .
so what we need , quite simply , is greater commitment and more support for a policy on space travel .
this is disproportionate and not targeted .
we will see what ukip looks like .
it is not all your fault , the council is also to blame .
demand is on the up ; the market is booming .

the country 's own fishery sector is still completely undeveloped .
furthermore , i really do hope that this is the last time that this will happen in such a way .
thirdly , he said : south africa has rejected any amendment of the agreement out of hand .
we have to reach a decision on this as well .
we are not discussing whether to say ' yes ' or ' no ' to gmos .
it has been discussed and will be discussed at forthcoming councils .
the next item is voting time .
my country , malta , also went through a similar change .
eur 325 million for prevention over five years is not much .
i would advise the commission to be on its mettle in the future .
the third point concerns getting the agency up and running .
what should we be working towards ?
so there are three points which we need to understand .
these are worthy aims .
as things stand today , they are bound to feel like second- or third - class victims .
these programmes require a differentiated instrument funded from other sources .
it has been made as simple as possible .
the issue is the financing of eu enlargement .
mr schulz seems to be better informed .
it would not be in israel 's interest to leave unanswered the allegations which have been made .

we must bring hope to large parts of the world that have to live in despair .
it is our common dream that is coming true ; it is our common aim that is being achieved .
we have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from 6 % to 12 % .
mrs bloch von blottnitz rightly said that we should have a certain amount of trust in the consumer .
they should be able to exercise their right to choose .
as the author is not present , question no 43 lapses .
the idea of cohesion is therefore one whose significance can not be overestimated .
we have striven to bring it back to parliamentarians , into the ownership of parliamentarians across the region .
the irish people are fully within their rights to vote as they have done .
but why is the commission in such a tearing hurry ?
i am not clear about what the centralist commission is about to produce as its final proposal .
it was adopted unanimously .
castagnède report ( a4 - 0252/98 )
i refer you to the proceedings for 18 - 19 june , page 18 : in connection with what mrs larive said just before mrs van dijk spoke .
declaration of financial interests : see minutes
this will be of mutual benefit to both european and third - country citizens .
this is a balanced piece of legislation and one which i feel happy to support .
amendments 108 to 112 take account of various documents concerning the following issues .
i will therefore begin by being demanding in our relations with the council .
i do not need to have your support to say it ...
however , safety must remain the guiding principle for the future , too .
we need to assist these people .
low - sulphur fuel is of course more expensive .
that was for a number of good reasons .
next session of un human rights commission
we , therefore , need a very clear signal .
the social fund has allocated resources for this .
surely , even an advance photocopy of the europass would serve the same purpose .
mr president , i am pleased that the whole parliament is so united on the subject of leyla zana .
the committee also raised the fundamental question of whether a new directive is actually needed at all .
are we going to put in unskilled workers to give us better results ?
the women ' s conference in beijing brought an important point to light .
the situation is in fact quite paradoxical .
the degree of freedom of resources for new initiatives is getting smaller .
as has already been said , this parliament has often said that it is against this agreement .
why not have the guts to just scrap parliament and take over europe by force ?
but it should not be taken for granted that it is the eu which should negotiate and regulate these issues .
there are just two concerns i would like to raise today .
8 . imports from greenland of fishery products (
after all , they are the infrastructure for the torture flights .
when will the proposal for a directive on basel ii be submitted ?
our patience with this can run out too quickly , indeed , but patience can also degenerate into indifference .
what are the subsequent steps planned by the commission in this area ?
i think that this method is punishing honest citizens .
if it is there to symbolize free speech , then i can certainly accept that .
no commission proposal has yet been submitted to the council on the issue you mentioned .
on a number of occasions i have heard the word availability mentioned .
with regard to the content , too , we find this proposal unacceptable .
it is a very healthy process for us all to be involved in .
cross - border work is very important in my region .
and i think that this is an important warning .
this is evidence of our interest and thus our belief that this report is useful .
we must reject that most emphatically .
i shall not go back over the sakharov prize .
at present , regional cooperation occurs de facto in the energy sector .
that is an analysis that i regard as inadequate and that my group does not support .
on your behalf i have sent a message of condolence to his widow .
subject : special support programme for peace and reconciliation
not very , i am afraid .
i would like to ask you to look into this as well .
it is mainly albania which holds the keys to the solution .
lastly , i have a few comments to make if i may .
we now come to the vote .
it is difficult to discern any further democratic developments during these first four months .
there is a great need for the council to act .
the answer is , firstly , its desire to act .
i would also warn against taking the voluntary approach .
as far as i am concerned , neither report is acceptable as it stands and i can not vote for them .
at present we have given this programme 0.1 % of the community budget .
we must not let the people of ethiopia down .
it is a necessary step , but it does not go far enough .
everything but arms represents significant progress .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate mr adamou on his work .
i would now like to come back to the stauner report and a number of points made in it .
society is changing ever more rapidly .
perhaps it would be possible for the european union to make similar opportunities available to young iraqis at the present time .
should it be necessary to stifle all differences of opinion to be a true european ?
the wording in clause 1.26 is in our opinion completely absurd .
6 . transparency in regional policy and its funding (
is there any justification for these differences ?
mr president , honourable members , allow me first of all to thank you and to congratulate you .
because one thing we do not have in europe is uniform criminal law .
they benefit from belonging to the euro area .
we must have examinations and assessments to move ahead with this process .
in my opinion , we can not have product placement in films in the same way as the us .
in writing . - ( de ) i voted in favour of the report on turkey 's progress towards eu membership in 2007 .
that is what it was aimed at , no more and no less .
on the contrary , hizbollah was arming itself massively for years .
ladies and gentlemen , i will try again .
and yet that has been put about , making people who object to this seem unreasonable .
i hope this will be listened to .
i apologise if there has been a mistake in translation .
clearly , in this respect , the g20 was incompetent .
mauritania is one of the world 's poorest countries and one of its newest oil producers .
this too is a question of democratic access to information .
first of all , there is the monitoring of state aid measures .
this is hardly an example of equal opportunities …
that awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism .
opening of the sitting
the budget is the ultimate expression of democracy and social development .
what is important is to keep our eyes on the horizon and to keep working towards it .
all i can do is urge this house to do as much .
the republic of moldova is on a positive trajectory .
the european union can play an important role in this context .
the next item is the vote .
in 2003 , 180 decisions closing cases following inquiries were made .
the following conclusions may be drawn from the outcome of the meeting .
( nl ) the recognition of language diversity within the eu is no folklore .
there is no hope any more .
lastly , the struggle against doping also relates to the development of research .
situation in chechnya
i hope that i am surprising no one when i too give my vigorous support to this view .
i really regret the media reports about barcelona .
thank you , mr barón crespo .
i 'm not one , and nor are my fellow meps !
this trade agreement has a positive role to fulfil here .
the president mentioned our electronic voting equipment .
is it proportionate and fair that the proceedings are filtered by the ministry of the interior ?
i welcome this , and it means we can also be happy with the result .
above all , however , we have been working to convince others for years .
we fully support amendments nos 1 , 2 , 18 and19 as they stand .
this is not easy .
this is simply not true .
further aid should be allocated to fund the employment of disadvantaged groups of workers .
very soon , at the beginning of next year , we will have all the evidence .
the next item is voting time .
that is not the case and we should make it clear : africa is a resource for us too .
taxpayers would thus get more from their taxes .
i will be delighted to take charge of those papers .
we need this regulation ; i am all for us getting it , and have been so for the past five years .
we are hoping , thereby , to have an influence on what comes out of the commission .
this means putting an end to the currently prevailing state of lawlessness and impunity .
but the key to stability is democracy .
costa neves and buitenweg report ( a5 - 0400/2001 )
i give the floor to the rapporteur , mrs randzio - plath .
. i would like to welcome the work of both rapporteurs .
there is no credible proof of mr   lukashenko ’s claim to have won the election .
we have had considerable quantitative success .
we say there that it should simply be accompanied by stringent safety conditions .
we do not need them at european level too .
again , that is an area we have not sought to change .
( the president cut the speaker off )
( parliament agreed to this proposal )
i welcome this excellent cooperation with parliament .
i very much welcome improved rights for consumers purchasing online .
what are the main themes ?
oh , just shut your trap !
it is essential that we come back to this issue in september .
of course , we are glad that some form of compromise was reached .
thus the substance of the action must have a legal base .
some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave .
you have demonstrated ambition here and that is a precious thing to us .
how can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?
we must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013 .
i believe we need to think again about what success criteria we should be applying and what objectives we should be pursuing .
13 . situation in the republic of moldova
the reference here to the university of padua is not correct .
strengthening the unity of the european union …
( the president cut off the speaker )
in that regard , i believe that this agreement sends a good message to the citizens .
the financial sector 's need for support measures has diminished .
so with the action plan we have a good programme .
as far as we are concerned , the political aspect is not an issue .
vote ( continuation )
personally i think that we need a floating threshold .
i am sorry it was such a struggle .
are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework ?
after all , the treaty of lisbon is dead .
soon bulgaria and romania will join .
i hope his legacy will be the accession of all current eu candidate countries .
in this context i should like to say two things .
despite the laudable efforts of the greek presidency in pushing for the adoption of common platforms , we remain divided on the question of iraq .
commissioner schreyer and i sent a letter to all dgs in july 2003 .
yes , it is a problem .
i am very much aware of mr rübig 's amendment , i approve of it and i recommend to the house that we vote in favour .
i am pleased about that ; it is a major step forward .
and finally , it is important not to play off large farms and small - sized producers against each other .
the people currently working with fair trade understand the problems .
it is clear that directive 77/187 will certainly apply in many situations .
i hope i do not have to sit in such a parliament .
this is not a terribly hard disease to cure .
that is really what we are discussing here .
mr valdivielso de cué has the floor .
( the sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m. )
this can not become the norm .
we should also ensure that cooperation agreements are established with third countries in this area .
the dayton agreements can not and will not make bosnia and the balkans work .
we should ask ourselves , honestly , what have they actually gained so far ?
mr president , i must say i am most disappointed with this report .
structural funds ( 1998 )
only two - thirds of that was spent ; 25 % of that was eaten up by administrative costs .
yesterday , they came here to parliament once again .
the fourth is from the united states .
poor greece , trapped inside the economic prison of the euro !
the democrats must also be supported .
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
on 1 january 1999 the european central bank will take over sole responsibility for monetary policy .
the cause of the tragedy is the israeli occupation .
it is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold .
therefore , it is important to keep these costs to a minimum .
we can not go on like this any longer !
of course i recognize that the living conditions of many animals in zoos are very poor .
i would like to refer to one area of identifiable need , my own country , wales .
we do not wish to see a neo - liberal europe in which market forces reign supreme .
the purpose of that provision is to speed up the procedure .
the scope of these extensions , however , is small .
instead this compromise means that the question of pbts will be dealt with at un level .
my group has tabled amendments on all of these points .
however , we have now taken an important step forwards and we need to push on even further .
at the same time , europe needs to be able to respond to unfair foreign subsidies .
i am indebted to him for this .
i do not know about the rest of europe .
i welcome this initiative and i hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible .
this is what we have decided .
thank you , commissioner and i certainly agree with the substance , particularly of the early part of your answer .
in our union there are still many deficiencies which we must clear up .
you must be unaware of this .
in writing . - ( fr ) exceptional situations call for exceptional resources .
the problem , as i see it , is this .
no cost analysis has been carried out .
it has become clear from the discussion how we must act .
every second , the tubercle bacillus claims another victim .
that was a good start .
something else enters into this , however .
we do not know how the next few days are going to turn out .
what we need is greater security .
i want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in ireland .
this is why i am abstaining from voting .
for that reason , it is a good thing that it is on the agenda today .
it is time for action .
mr president , it is my privilege to speak again in a debate with mrs halonen .
rejection may not be palatable , but it must be faced .
and
how do we act beyond the union 's borders ?
here we are today , more than two years later , and this is as far as we have got .
whistle - blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise .
this is the role of this agency , and let us respect it .
we demand his immediate and unconditional release .
how much are renewable energy sources being subsidised ?
paragraph 11 requires some linguistic clarification on one point , however .
it is impossible , commissioner , to rest when you have to put up with an atrocious nightmare of noise .
first , it taught us how to throw money down the drain .
that is quite clearly a war crime .
nobody would dispute that .
the fact that we are suspending the agreement procedures does not mean that we want to isolate belarus .
the fourth point concerns the situation of ms souha bechara .
fuel alternatives are extremely welcome .
for us poles , whom i represent here , the word ' solidarity ' has great significance .
it would be useful if you could link these problems on a regional basis and act from that point .
tastes are certainly culturally conditioned .
a good first step would be to begin to publish the minutes of the ecb council meetings .
the commission has invested a lot in this issue .
mr president , romania has made exceptional progress in recent months .
of course the murder of a journalist is a terrible thing .
we can not of course allow this situation to continue without taking measures to combat it .
this is a familiar feature of the commissioner 's homeland and my own .
the albanian people need us .
others have tried to pave the way for a regulation of general interest .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
first of all , we have to see how to guarantee this funding .
it will be resumed at 3 p.m.
i know that the council is of the same opinion .
in accordance with the constitution of the republic of poland , the president is obliged to sign .
above all europe needs to be taken over by argumentative people .
women only appear in the background .
but is the hungarian government at home ?
now it is time for you to roar in the council .
then quasimodo would have been credible .
this parliament has got to start taking its debates seriously itself .
he led the negotiations in a very sensitive and positive political style .
these rights should therefore be included in the first part of the charter .
is there another , different , european employment strategy which the parliaments should not be allowed to take decisions on ?
we propose the introduction of biological rest periods when species are particularly under threat .
action taken must be in proportion to what is reasonable for each country .
i am convinced that we shall succeed .
some people harbour the illusion that negotiations could begin in one or two years ' time .
i should also like to ask for a certain amount of consistency in this parliament .
- before the vote on paragraph 161
i think it is that above all else that i remember , myself , from the commission 's predictions .
these are the results that have been achieved in the areas which have been deregulated and liberalised .
i feel , however , that certain points need further emphasis .
aid must become simpler , less centralised , more environmentally friendly and create more jobs .
we think that we are probably doing this with the increased number of debates that are open .
initially , freedom of movement was reserved for people who were economically active .
where should sweden make these cutbacks ?
mr president , i welcome marco polo in principle and in practice .
the structural funds should be used more actively and more in keeping with the situation .
question no 7 by john mccartin ( h-0860/98 )
that is what they look for in the committee on petitions .
now is the time for the eu ' s own institutions to comply with the same standards .
so the significance is far from small .
on financial markets we are essentially in agreement .
the commission communication on this issue is expected at the start of 2007 .
i can not use it again , and that was the point at issue in the question .
it is a quote from genesis .
if the addition of sugar is decided , then it must be stated on the label .
it sounded otherwise .
the words have lost none of their relevance , rather the contrary .
lastly , each individual form of transport is not important in itself .
yet this is still not enough .
i hope that the italian presidency can do so .
we should not just talk , but act .
the effective hungarian constitution , if you will allow me to say a word about this , begins with the date 1949 .
what a member state does has implications in the other member states .
the debate is closed .
therefore , i would draw your attention to the wisdom of an old rabbi .
i am one of those who believes that sovereignty resides in the hands of the people .
acquire a more comprehensive circle of advisers .
i would just like to make four points .
the cambodians have slowly started to move .
but equally an individual country should not be forced to participate actively either .
neither fear is an accurate representation of reality .
hiv / aids in developing countries
we can also see contradictions in the resolution .
we support this position .
we can not allow doctors to be on duty for too long .
more than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules .
poverty can affect anyone .
world trade is unequal .
furthermore , the project has certain negative political implications .
thank you very much for your cooperation with parliament this afternoon , mr monti .
that takes courage on both sides .
now to the cod plan and the oral question .
so let us try to reconcile both principles in a way .
and not only are the costs high , there is also a considerable element of risk involved .
these procedures should , therefore , be simplified .
it is for that reason that i , along with my colleagues as a whole , have voted against the report .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
i do not defend christians against muslims .
the eu also has an important role to play in the reconstruction process .
a european aviation safety authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency .
the economy is healthy and people appear to be facing the future with confidence .
carnero gonzález report ( a4 - 0418/96 )
clearly , he acted disloyally with regard to the common position he was bound by .
what does the euro mean to these people ?
but what are those shortfalls ?
it is doing a lot to recycle and re - use its raw materials .
i shall not refer again to the previous episodes , of which we are all aware .
the result of conciliation which we agree to with bad grace is no solution .
it was originally scheduled for 7 september .
in writing . - i welcome this contribution to the consumer scoreboard from parliament .
let us not talk of positive discrimination quotas or anything else .
in 2015 , say ?
what you said today leaves me quite astonished .
question no 4 by ( h-0609/99 ) :
in this context , the directly - elected irish parliament would be bypassed .
the situation in the region has greatly deteriorated compared to what it was a few months ago .
these , ladies and gentlemen , are just some of the many objectives contained in our communication .
we should , indeed , condemn all these matters and we should protest very strongly against them .
the bloodshed of 21 january dragged tirana backwards by several years .
we need to look at it with a clear head .
for me , however , it is a question of injured people and their families .
there were even extremist movements in our european democracies .
mr garcía - margallo marfil 's report is an excellent one , since relevant comparisons could well open europe 's eyes .
food prices in europe ( short presentation )
the evaluation of progress and of shortcomings in the candidate countries has always been clear and detailed .
we have made progress on all these areas .
functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous .
mr president , i believe this is the line the european union should take .
why did you take only the two largest groups ?
finally , one aspect of the reform deserves greater attention .
we are pleased that our standpoint on the amendment of paragraph 21 was listened to .
mrs diamantopoulou , do you wish to make any comment ?
hopefully we can get a decent night 's sleep some time in the future .
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0020/2000 )
and if it has been completed , what effects has it had ?
the regional governments just wanted to serve as models here on wage dumping matters .
the issue is how restructuring should be managed and who should do the managing .
it should also be borne in mind that the amounts involved were quite small .
the report also puts forward various proposals for ways of achieving this .
we have followed the textbook of democracy to the letter .
this could be extremely significant in showing the path we are to go down .
after all , as a taxpayer he or she has already paid for this information .
we can not possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation .
young people die of new variant cjd , and there is silence .
i was travelling to baku and could only get back with great difficulties .
it is quite clear that what we are engaged in here is research and development .
but the monitoring of the whole scheme seems to me to have been too theoretically conceived .
yes , i wholeheartedly agree with you .
i entirely agree .
only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen .
composition of committees : see minutes
there would be no inspection and no disarmament .
mrs goulard spoke about this just now .
there is no blank cheque ; instead we are getting a study .
the commission knows this .
we therefore need an explanation and we need it now , not in september .
madam president , the eastern partnership is still very new .
therefore there is a little reason to praise or to blame all irish people .
this is why there is a choice to make here .
the commission expressly calls for the ecopoint system to continue .
that is why i voted for the report on the european environment agency .
as you can see , from these various subjects , europe must continue .
( the sitting was closed at 8.52 p.m. )
i therefore ask you to take more account of that in your work
that is something else on which we agree , and this joint resolution says so .
employees should have new rights in companies at all levels .
i have to say that the remaining amendments are unacceptable .
you did not do so .
let us talk politics , first of all .
india deserves its own dedicated european parliament delegation .
that is our desire .
natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard .
i have therefore tried , particularly in the last year , to deliver this message .
it is no different with georgia .
1 . appointment of the president of the european central bank : mr mario draghi , candidate (
i am pleased that mrs larive 's report agrees with this approach .
in writing . - ( sv ) the eu should have strong consumer protection .
there is no hierarchy of oppression .
that is all i have to say .
but we do not agree with the format of the resolution as regards point 6 .
( the president cut off the speaker )
there are still forces that are seeking to knock developments in afghanistan off course .
whereas some of the reasons for this are historical , others are very much more up - to - date and practical .
it is also true that short documents save trees .
that indeed is what happens in the united kingdom .
however , these groups include only elected members .
only 5 % of hiv - positive children receive medical help .
this is totally inadequate for those not of independent means .
i am able to state that mr solana has not visited cyprus since he took office .
our rights must be further extended .
and is it still not the case that waste is quite a special product ?
we know the list from the budget , but we do not know every committee .
the european union must therefore be ready to withstand the flow of migration .
some proposals have been made to me .
for example , we need to ensure that libya finally has an asylum system .
a commitment to prevention is also important .
i am pleased to see that mr groote 's report takes account of these proposals .
let me turn to the contentious issue of the a-30 lines .
in two thirds of sweden 's municipalities , the population has been on the decrease for several years now .
the next item is the order of business .
all of this has been fiendishly planned .
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
that is why it was necessary for the others to cooperate with us .
there are currently 83 lisbon directives which we have passed in the european parliament .
therefore , we also see the programmes proposed in the annex as minimum requirements .
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
as i say , i am quoting from an english translation .
the objective is crystal clear : we all want to live long , healthy lives .
in fact , article 290 refers precisely to this matter .
our electorate must be able to demand that of us .
this is not justified and would further unbalance the negotiations .
i will just quickly run through some of them .
it is clear that this can not go on .
the commission , too , has set new priorities for it .
i would therefore like to ask the president of parliament to tell us who is now representing the council in this debate .
there is a separate remark for the agency enlargement costs .
question no 39 by david bowe ( h-0682/96 )
this is simply a fact .
one fairly prosaic example is the toilet paper tube .
i wish all the best to the slovaks in the euro zone .
nobody wants to change the geneva convention but we can complement the convention .
this also applies to the investment bank .
but we need some clarification on some issues .
thank you all for your attention .
that is what i am calling for here today .
i should like to mention two other points .
society is experiencing a crisis of values .
however , it also covers other olaf documents , measures and investigations .
question no 3 by jonas sjöstedt ( h-0599/97 )
the commissioners can not countersign the declarations of the directors - general .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
this situation has to change .
12 . croatia : 2007 progress report (
mr kronberger and the commissioner have mentioned the possibility of a first reading agreement .
my own country has also been experiencing an influx of both legal and illegal migrants .
anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt .
for a long time to come we shall be deeply involved in assisting the state - building process in kosovo .
the experience of many countries over many years should vouch for the use of substitute materials .
hence , i believe that it would be a good idea to avoid cutting these budgets .
corrections to votes from previous sittings : see minutes
i hope that we reach a swift solution with regard to this .
this is the conclusion which we must draw from recent years .
question no 10 by ( h-0547/01 ) :
i should therefore quickly like to say three things .
mr   president , that was my last speech here in the european parliament .
this shows how outdated europe is : the tax village is becoming global .
mrs gonzález álvarez , naturally it is difficult for us to intervene from here .
in some areas competition is already taking place , as in the parcels sector and in the express services .
the eurodac data exchange takes much too long .
the commission is now confronted by the shattered remnants of european agriculture .
question no 44 by , which has been taken over by mihail papayannakis(h-0866/01 ) :
that is a way of opening ourselves up to prior censorship .
that is the first point which i wished to make here .
i welcome this new law on behalf of my constituents .
one minute would be even better .
if people are dissatisfied with the system , they must change the system .
consumer policy is , of course , a key element in achieving this .
our fellow meps have illustrated this amply .
thank you , commissioner solbes .
in 2007 , it was implemented .
around 30 % of the members of our parliament are women .
i believe that there is not ; i believe that the situation is precisely the opposite .
today ' s world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity .
finally , primarily tools ...
so the commission has already a large number of reports to work on .
this is a population that has been under siege for a very long time .
first of all , learn to take responsibility , learn to govern .
where will this madness end ?
in december , around 87 % of portuguese territory was suffering from extreme drought .
we strongly urge the member states to ensure that this principle is strictly upheld .
this is marvellous and i wish it happened with other reports .
i think that one of the most important points arising in this context is the involvement of the trade .
the main building blocks of our proposals are threefold .
we still have hopes that we will be able to return to this issue .
do you know how many heart attacks are due to dairy products ?
a very unfair impression has been left here by these three cases .
to portray it in the complete opposite way of what is intended is completely disingenuous .
i should like to consider this issue by referring to one specific aspect of transport policy .
i could phrase this loosely .
after detroit , to give you an example , the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution .
galileo , iter , the eu 2020 strategy , the european external action service - they all cost money !
a new situation has arisen .
i have no reason to question the motives of the candidates chosen .
we had to establish an ad hoc mechanism , which we have just used to support ireland .
1 . belarus on the political agenda
mexico stands to gain here by achieving a better trade equilibrium .
that is why i request that this report be postponed until parliament ' s next part - session .
so we are very pleased with this .
we already have a register of interests .
make no mistake : ireland is pro - european .
we must not reduce the citizens to mere consumers .
as stated in the report , it may be a bridge , but not a foundation .
in other words , this constitutional treaty is today the best possible agreement .
commissioner pinheiro , what on earth is the commission doing ?
for the process is stagnating .
that is extremely important .
there can be no excuse for terrorism - no excuse whatsoever !
having spoken to him i have no doubt that he believes he has honest cause .
and whom will this dialogue affect exactly ?
explanations of vote - haug report ( a5 - 0070/2000 )
mr millán mon 's report brings up all these important issues .
they are told just how indebted their countries are every day .
it is pointless to talk about the peace agreement : it is finished .
we therefore now see it as a very important task to rebuild and strengthen the un .
however , i know that you want me to be as practical as possible .
this wording is too vague .
we are not only talking about enlargement of the eu , but also about the tasks for the daphne programmes .
another point is the ecosystems in groundwater .
neither can we continually argue , in view of the situation .
the budget is under threat .
there are 30 people sitting up here .
implementation should be regulated through a commission action plan .
that was our wish .
what we need to discuss are the policies to be applied .
it is clear that we continue to support this .
it may be possible to arrange for us to continue today 's discussion next tuesday .
we urge you to pull out the eufor troops !
let me give you two examples from the transport sector .
this is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which , indeed , contravenes the financial regulation .
it seems that to many , a woman 's life is not as valuable .
we shall here mention only three points .
it is simply impossible to apply an arithmetical division into equal halves .
it was confirmed on this occasion that the first kosovo donor conference would be held on 28 july in brussels .
certain new facts have arisen during 1996 .
but this house has positions on certain items it will not relinquish .
mr president , europe is increasing as far as the age of its people is concerned .
these are the new talking shops .
minsk thinks that it is not acceptable to support the opposition like that .
i also regret that we have missed the opportunity to amend the annexes .
the previous leonardo programme was technically a good one too , and ten times oversubscribed .
they have a real problem servicing this debt .
flexibilization , tax improvements , better training - all these things are necessary . the ideas are right .
there are unfortunately many other forces aiming for that .
action in this field is urgent .
the debate is closed .
the commission should help us in this .
what he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market .
this is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional state and of an economy .
the next item is question time ( b6 - 0017/2006 ) .
mr president , i am rather surprised at what i am hearing .
as far as we are concerned , however , the member states may retain their fully - fledged commissioners .
congratulations once again to the rapporteur !
i have repeated it in spanish , which is one of the european union 's global languages .
that is a dishonest approach !
we need more roma women in decision making as well .
we want to guarantee stability in europe , both now and in the long term .
this is a considerable step forward .
it remains for us to examine whether the programme , as it has been formulated , is effective .
( de ) my question concerns the common measures that could help us .
we must therefore preserve the traditional growing methods in europe .
on this point , parliament is about to take an irresponsible decision .
there will be no success in rebalancing growth without addressing currency tensions .
. – mr president , i have a suggestion to put to the house and to the member who put that motion to it .
that question must be answered .
the crisis is not the ' euro crisis in greece ' .
i therefore wish the european union to support the holding of these elections .
i have indicated those questions i want to take up to the time of 20:45 .
however , that really is not enough .
other important issues are , for example , what happens to the electronic signature ?
so we must not give too much weight to the problem , only where it is dangerous .
the group of the european people 's party is presenting them once again for several reasons .
they remain in force ; nothing has changed here .
mrs randzio - plath has picked up some noises from the oecd and mentioned the word mega - risk .
migration policy is not just an eu matter .
there has been an exchange of letters on this subject between your house and the council .
only if the economy is healthy can we invest in the environment .
seized by despair , they hijacked the aeroplane and forced it to land in sudan .
if we include broad areas , it undoubtedly leads to endless debate .
it is important that information on the quality of goods reaches the consumer .
in other words , it hinders development and increases developmental inequalities .
mr president , the same applies to me .
secondly , the report points the finger at a number of countries which do not respect human rights .
france and italy were left out in the cold .
i fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .
they produce wine .
if we are critical , we are so in the interest of ukraine .
in the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice .
similar efforts are in progress in other countries .
this resolution goes in the right direction .
does this mean that we are absolutely satisfied ?
thursday 23 june 2011
the problem with eu sanctions has been their lack of rigorous enforcement .
that is a long - standing debate .
this speech , which was a little humorous , provoked a huge roar of laughter amongst those i was addressing .
i therefore propose five points , which are the contributions of the gue / ngl group to the various reports .
the debate is closed .
there is another point i want to make in this connection .
such actions run counter to the stated aims of the lisbon strategy .
these matters continue to be national concerns .
there is no need for me to read it out .
we will continue to build on it , because it needs to be the basis of cooperation for the next seven years .
a lot of valid remarks have already been made in this respect .
this concerns the designation e407 or e408 for treated eucheuma algae .
there is only one europe , and it is our home europe .
the eu needs to break out of its own vicious circle at last .
we should stay away from beijing at this time .
this is not by chance ; the neighbouring countries always know the situation better .
we must act , and we must do more than we are doing at the moment .
this will be another check on democracy in the country .
perhaps you could let me know .
it is a shame that these proposals should be so weak , but i shall come back to that in a few moments .
i too will try to state my views clearly and concisely on a number of points .
politically based arguments should not stand in the way of the economic interests of the eu .
we should be making that case here .
as i said before , i quite agree with mrs ahlqvist 's assessment of the situation .
i now ask you all to rise for a minute 's silence .
i must specifically reply to some of the issues that have been raised just now .
thank you , mr provan .
we shall take advantage of the benefits that electronics can offer later .
besides , almost all consumers want full information about the foods they buy .
resumption of the session
i should like to ask the president - in - office what he is going to do about this .
will you respect the irish vote ?
the result is that it becomes difficult for prosecutors and the police to work effectively .
this is something which environment commissioner , mrs wallström , has always been very keen on .
let me first of all thank you for the kind reaction from parliament .
the european socialists are ready for this challenge .
so i am not in favour of censorship but of self - regulation , and codes of conduct .
thus two - thirds of the staff are locally recruited .
it was expressly mentioned in the reply from parliament in the green paper that you mentioned .
workers can be forced to work in excess of their driving hours .
from a personal point of view , it is a pleasure for me to work with my friend jean - claude juncker .
however , just to refer to this situation is unacceptable !
the first of two focal points is energy efficiency : a great opportunity .
the debate is closed .
you referred particularly to the treaty .
he still has to face trial on an old case of " spying " .
following that , i have another question regarding the campaign against julian assange .
to what is the large number of errors due ?
this anomaly must be resolved without delay .
everything that followed was linked to this admission and was the consequence of it , so to speak .
but we have to bear in mind two issues .
we do not need any generalisations or insults nor do we need insinuation .
so this was a kind of inaugural act , an act which was necessary .
mugabe 's misrule and corruption are paralysing the entire country .
that is the only thing we ask of you .
the report also stresses the fiscal sovereignty of the member states .
we need sober thinking and creative decisions .
commissioner frattini , you are denying the obvious .
they are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the irish airline .
for this reason , i have not voted in favour of this report .
we must not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by a sort of budgetary imperialism .
this is not yet the case with the service providers .
we have sub - arctic temperatures in the winter .
individual states often retain their own rules , regulations , procedures and performance standards .
in my report , the number 7 is proposed .
we regard this as an essential requirement .
this unification is considered to be positive by the commission ' s report .
the following changes have been proposed :
other examples abound .
european added value has been mentioned with regard to erasmus mundus .
the building , tourism and gastronomy industries are particularly affected .
i usually follow parliamentary practice .
what should be done in such cases ?
lapsed written declarations : see minutes
i would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated .
from the point of view of budgetary control , 2008 will be another disappointing year .
the number of people being killed on the roads has been mentioned several times today .
we need to give them solace . .
this was proved by the danish experience .
so there are things to be glad about .
allow me now to turn to the court 's key audit findings for 2005 .
mr president , mr   verhofstadt , i feel i must applaud your resoluteness .
thirdly : treatment and follow - up .
have specific projects already been drawn up ?
however , i hold on to what commissioner almunia has said , and that is : act quickly and effectively .
i became aware then of the enormous gulf that lies between our line of thinking and their line of thinking .
i can only say , yes , we do need one .
thank you once again .
the economic and financial crisis has affected the entire population .
neither of them would ever come forward with any positive support to help the fishermen .
another point is where to invest money .
written statements ( rule 142 )
i regard the raising of the ceiling from eur 70 to 140 million as important .
islamic fundamentalism is growing strong in the suburbs of our towns and cities .
langen report ( a4 - 0021/99 )
a second set of questions also needs answers .
of course , i can not accept this situation .
we are , therefore , aiming for consistency rather than to cover a whole range of problems .
what we have in february is a hearing .
how does the situation look for the next support period , as far as you can tell ?
i agree with the speakers who said that this is a great day .
a number of members of the council were not prepared to accept that reference should be made to this issue other than in a recital .
we need to establish what we are determined to retain , what we are not prepared to give up .
we are surprised when the people in the maghreb countries all want to move here .
in this case , the victims were a civilian and two policemen carrying out their duties .
this bubble has now turned out to be exactly what many people said it was all along .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
in my opinion , this can also be said of the european union 's 2020 strategy .
we voted in favour of this .
last but not least , i would like to revisit the subject of comitology .
electronic tagging : we are not ready for it .
nevertheless i will take the vote seriously , as it is in fact about italy .
in addition , however , there are three important matters to be discussed before the end of the year .
i conclude with the central importance of the user and the consumer .
the question remains : what does all this have to do with the constitution and the draft constitution ?
it is now time for us to turn our words into deeds .
the statute has to be adopted unanimously .
you know we have always been committed to russia 's wto accession .
these results were fed back , in the form of a report , to the european council itself .
could we cite its dealings in relation to cyprus or the kurdish question , or the treatment meted out to christian minority groups in turkey ?
one of the essential problems affecting public services is competition .
we should not , however , create additional barriers and obstacles .
we hope everyone will approve this addition .
nobody knows exactly how much is invested .
this brings me immediately to my second point .
our cooperation with commissioner kinnock and directorate - general vii was also very fruitful .
you do not have the floor .
we urge the commission to show flexibility .
( b5 - 0202/2002 ) by mr salafranca sánchez - neyra , on behalf of the ppe - de group , on guatemala ;
last week i was in denmark .
on behalf of our group , i want to make two further , more specific , points .
we are demanding that the industrialised countries fulfil their responsibility .
mr president , this constitutional treaty is worth upholding .
everything is therefore still open .
what is perhaps most important in my opinion is the lack of chemical safety .
it will apply to such areas as maritime cargo transport and logistics .
general de gaulle once said that policy in france was not just a matter of money .
my own region , the west midlands , is a case in point .
10 . mobilisation of the european union 's solidarity fund (
that is the only way of building the confidence required for accession .
i see a risk that the revision of the constitution may not be dealt with .
did he not listen ?
quite clearly , the second alternative has been selected in the case of dublin .
i believe , however , that we should nevertheless remember european producers .
i thank you and i thank my fellow members .
it is great news for the cause of freedom .
it is very important that we have clear , reliable and accurate statistics , as we have seen recently .
mr president , on a point of order .
i can only recommend to parliament that it make its approval of accession conditional upon this .
consequently , the quality of administration was particularly important .
member of the commission .
why do we not , at long last , give up on it ?
the situation is very unequal , and there is a risk of its deteriorating further .
this shows great maturity .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
this presents serious problems in its internal market , which shows a continuing deficit of approximately 60 % .
those , along with the five florence agreement provisions were all enacted .
hopefully these final steps will take the form of a final sprint .
it is in fact the ' communitarisation ' of the third pillar .
europe is still full of fears and prejudices which must be overcome .

that is indeed controversial .
it leads to a lot of confusion .

the debate is closed .

the most urgent problem of the present time - high unemployment - therefore requires particularly careful attention .
documents received : see minutes
my second point concerns the question of priorities .
yes , we can do that if it would be helpful .
i hope we can create a more effective framework here .
it is not going to be a quick fix for afghanistan .

more room means growth and employment .
a european neighbourhood policy can be effective if it is carried out jointly .

since kyoto , the eu has dealt with the matter at the highest political level .
further challenges await us .
we can not , we must not , have a situation in which internal market directives are not transposed .
because , after all , they were to be a starting point for the continuing development of democratic structures .
mr president , mrs cederschiöld , ladies and gentlemen , how safe is the euro ?
the signs are worrying .
well , this is what we have done here .
composition of parliament : see minutes
if we do not make this investment , the united states will .
good luck to everyone and let us formulate our proposal to the european parliament so that it can vote for this report .
we did not reach a conclusion then .
( fr ) mr president , there has to be consistency in politics .
the programmes designed for these purposes must be strengthened and enhanced .

now we have the opportunity to do so , and we must use it .
thank you for your work !
these need to be dealt with because the improvements introduced by the current proposal do not go far enough .
i would therefore like to put the following request to you .
you have used the word ' disability ' many times and have expounded to us all the disability programmes .
what we have seen in the referenda is actually nothing new .
what can we say to them today ?
yes , mr president , but do n't worry , i shall be brief .
commissioner , you are known as someone who always takes the opinion of this house very seriously .
mr president , i would like to mention three points :
we could do nothing by means of quotas .
but we come up against other pyramids , and we ourselves are involved , every day , in building pyramids .
subject : victims of the war in iraq
the commission 's own fraud fighting service , uclaf , is also active .
we are conscious of the fact , however , that we can not sit back indefinitely .

all forms of provocation must be avoided .
there was an application for his release , but that has now been rejected .
indicators are not a goal in themselves .
so , i just wanted to make it clear to all colleagues .
that may show willing , but it is not enough .
that does not seem to be the case for all the people of the uk .
it was not easy to reach a compromise on this issue .
that letter arrived after governor taseer 's murder .
however , we must not overestimate the role of the public sector .
nobody will be competing with us on that .
one such camp became public knowledge a few months ago .
could i very briefly mention three points on the humanitarian front .
we trade with these countries and also negotiate with them on equal terms .
i am thinking in particular of the lingua programme which has been set up by the eu .
i know that this is a project which is close to the commissioner 's heart .
it is time to say enough is enough .
you should have a shake - up of the advisers who are closest to your colleagues in the commission .
in the future europe must comprise three institutional circles .
in writing . - one in five women has been subjected to domestic violence in europe .

mr president , i wish to thank the president - in - office .
cooperation on the issue of energy is not progressing satisfactorily .
this is , of course , a very serious matter .
i would also like to thank you for your very detailed answer , mr yiannitsis .
it is the geopolitical benefits of the accession of these countries that are the deciding factor for me however .
today , people are perhaps going to die in france .
as the report implies , this has been nothing but a catalogue of errors .
it is also important , therefore , to examine taxation at union level .
i should also like to thank the rapporteur , mr beazley and all the speakers .
who is responsible for the fact that greece has delivered inaccurate budget figures ?
solidarity can not , by definition , be called for from one side alone , though .
that is something which needs to be considered carefully when we look at the budget for 2003 .
( the president cut off the speaker )
i consider amendment 18 of the chichester report to fall under the competence of the council .
we can perhaps do that in this case , but certainly not outside this area .
mr president , let me come back to a point we discussed at nine o'clock this morning .
this is in the interests of all the groups .
current expenditure , too , could also , of course , be held up to the light .
we have a responsibility for the future of the whole world .
the next item is the debate on :

it is a sector that has been particularly exposed to the globalisation process .
i hope that i have succeeded in this .
resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow .
as regards the second point , the new strategy lays down ambitious objectives .
i would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .
there is the rub !
the enormous advantages for tourists are highlighted with a great deal of verve .
yet ukraine is no exception .
the register will change little ; the lobbyists will always get through .
let me give you just two reasons for this .
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs   lucas and thank her for her report .
regarding amendment no 126
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
but quite clearly , we are frustrated .
fire prevention requires us to keep farming our land .
there are a couple of points that we must deal with again when it comes to second reading .
the right of artists to have their works protected must also be guaranteed in the age of the internet .
all member states must introduce - urgently - nationwide breast screening .
we need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services .
so much has changed .
we welcome this conclusion .
that was paradoxical because the issue had been seen as perhaps an obstacle to growth .
the hungarian minister 's body language is also saying yes .

immigration is a social reality , pure and simple .
man could be seen as being created in the image of god .
the first part was to be devoted to security , the second part to defence .
the com in wine would eventually become a com in property .
it is right that we should continuously return to this question .
with regard to staff , i would like to mention two points .
children themselves have access to violence on the internet , which must be objectionable to us all .
what was actually envisaged was nothing more than for turkey to participate in the europe of the single market .
mr president - in - office , you were intrigued by the questioner .
meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .
mr president , the coffee market is currently undergoing a serious crisis .
clarification is essential here , and in short order .
we shall now proceed to the speeches , which must not last longer than one minute .
the written procedure for adoption by the commission is under way .
cohesion policy can also play an important role .
it reinforces the schengen border code .
i have some comments concerning the legal aspect .
that would be one contentious issue fewer .
that is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months .
we take political decisions extremely seriously .
( parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote )
( applause and laughter ) i mean comrade in the ' comradely ' way .
there are limits to arrogance .
thank you very much for the information that you have provided today .
one might wonder , therefore , why these women do not inform against their pimps .
actually , i would have preferred it the other way round .
what else should we expect them to say ?
do 32 members support this proposal ?
it needs a new european injection of energy .
thank you , mrs de palacio .
that obviously brings complexity and a risk of errors .
despite the contradictions , a ‘ no’ vote in france will be the best answer .
the annual economic report represents an excellent basis for that .
whose interests come first ?
i am one of those who would have liked to go a step further .
so that does not present too many problems .
to do this , it is not enough to meet the copenhagen criteria and merely confirm them formally .
it is important that the european parliament stays the course with its relations with burma .
human resources benchmarking is especially important .
a few of the reasons are typically belgian .
the sun shines on everyone .

( the minutes were approved )
combating cancer in the enlarged eu ( debate )
that is my opinion , and i will continue to ask council to act on this invitation .
we have to stick with it and we are going to use it .
( loud and sustained applause )
and we would call on mr prodi to present us with proposals in that direction .
we try to do it in different ways .
it is about the conservation of the natural resources , valuable landscapes and endangered species .
however , i am not entirely sure it will help - and if so , for how long .
romania and bulgaria could be an anniversary present for the schengen area .
we then come to the subject of supervision , mr prodi .
that concludes the vote .
the stability pact concerns the crisis in the western balkans , in former yugoslavia .
dropping it to 2.5 km has placed an extremely heavy burden on them in the form of extra costs .
this should be the message going out to the industry from the commission white paper .
i believe that the key to ending this lies in southern africa .
we just have to put it all together and fashion it into a meaningful whole .
i would therefore like to insert the following in recital j :
these doubts can not simply remain confined to the newspapers .
we stand ready , president barroso , to work with you to achieve those goals .
mr president , this is a vital issue for europe .
yet something good came out of it .
this requirement can only be met on a world - wide basis .
this is a good approach , which is something that characterises the report as a whole .
the finnish government has certainly started this process .
the question is , how do we utilise them ?
why are innocent victims entitled to less consideration than delinquents ?
the integration of road transport alone could even prove counterproductive for the overall project .

in the last 12 months , the inflation rate in lithuania has been slightly above the threshold value .
mrs matikainen - kallström , i think mr martin wants to speak about the same subject .
peace and stability are entirely in its interest .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 5 may 2009 ) .
i agree completely with my colleague , mrs hirsch , on that point .
a number of questions arise from your claim .
those are the twin pillars that support our policy objectives .
that is a disgraceful attitude !
we , too , are trying to advance regional integration – how did europe manage it ?
this amended draft is equally unacceptable .
subject : progress on the temporary agency workers directive
so we will take up mrs thors ' topic .
the osce represents a forum for seeking such solutions .
he should be putting it to the british government .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
thank you , minister , for your first response during your presidency .
the report contains many excellent ideas about the labour market in the future .
we have made that quite plain to him .
( the sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
china is crumbling from within as a result of environmental problems .
we must now await moscow 's reaction .

the serbian troops who were initially withdrawn have long since returned .
it is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial .
an important change of vocabulary has taken place and commissioner pinheiro has used that new vocabulary .
sitcen provides logistical and information support .
the solution that has now been found is a very good one .
i utterly repudiate this .
the debate is closed .
it is therefore high time that legislation was drafted in this field .
this is no longer acceptable .
our basic assumption is that our primary interest is in protecting the public .
so it is the percentage which is being debated .
if i may digress slightly , i think the whole procedure is a good example of why the council ought in future to meet in public .
sesar is a step on the way but we must do more in this respect .
but we should walk before we insist on running .
i believe the mutual opening of markets should be an absolute priority for us .
the use of condoms has been compared to playing russian roulette .
mrs ahern , we have taken note of this .
come on , let ' s go and eat some delicious hot dogs ! '
mr president , i would also like to say thank you for this interesting and valuable debate .
manchester - style capitalism has been too much for russia to bear .
i wish to thank you for this debate and the feedback .
we demand action from the council , sadly absent this evening .
this is intended to achieve that end .
these are absolutely clear barriers which should be systematically dismantled ...
the agreement signed in mid - october is temporary and valid until the end of july 2007 .
in our view , that should and must now change as a matter of urgency .
we can not build european capabilities by shutting down our own factories .
i would , therefore , like to ask the commissioner how the first year , the year 2001 , is likely to take shape ?
the point is that this report is not about fundamental freedoms .
they want some new intergovernmental arrangement .
prevention , of course , is better than cure .
we would like to thank the commissioner for intimating this .
in some eu countries , it is hypocritical to claim that everyone has a right to work .
in denmark , for example , some additional financing is via government funds .
however , i am not inclined to sacrifice quality for speed .
i think we should speak openly about both of these forms of totalitarianism .
indeed , the budget is , by definition , a forecast .
the text now refers to opening branch offices for agencies .
we should not forget this in today 's debate .
the people of ostend will welcome approval of this section .
however , i would urge the commission not to overreact .
he wanted to put a very unpleasant ideological slant on the matter .
there has been a huge growth in the amount of money being used to support this production .
i would simply say , in conclusion , that we shall be equal to the task in terms of vigilance and firmness .
that is why this agreement should not lower environmental and social standards .
these two acts are strongly mutually linked .
that is a matter for deliberation in the council .
but mr corbett has a very strong point .
yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources .
i do not think that 13 is too young to participate in ' youth in action ' .
the report presents the stereotypical image of islam as terrorism .
announcement by the president
mr buzek spoke of combating climate change .
we can no longer wait for administration to be simplified .
mr scapagnini welcomes the commission 's communication , with which i can only agree .
more europe can not be achieved with less money , especially not now there are 25   member states .
it will be difficult to dismiss the arbiter in the event of a wrong judgement .
i should like to make three brief remarks in this respect .
when will you finally visit a prison ?
ladies and gentlemen , several of you have spoken of darfur .
i shall certainly be here .
however , there is still more to be done .
developing countries need capital in order to develop .
after the igc is finished we will be moving to even greater expansion .
subject : repercussions of enlargement on the least - favoured regions
that surprises us and worries us a great deal .
there is great mistrust in the region over the gas pipeline project .
i am happy to say it is the very last time !
they either are or are not .
documents received : see minutes
i do not think that we can rush into a premature decision about the next step .
with the introduction of the euro , there can be no easy policies .
i emphatically support the three amendments mr hughes has talked about .
for this reason , i have voted against the motion for a resolution .
there is a problem , however : neither you nor they are ready .
in this debate , i should like to make three appeals .
if we want to act , then , it seems that there are three priorities to fulfil .
the criminal court would rather benefit from depoliticisation .
that will be corrected , mr sturdy .
the debate is closed .
thank you commissioner lamy .
our second focus must be on the supply side of the market .
for these reasons , the commission is obliged to reject the twelve amendments proposed .
the credibility of the european union is once again at stake .
i fully endorse this view .
i do not believe we are in disagreement about our aims after this discussion .
there are employment problems , there are employees .
decision on urgent procedure
i think they are essential improvements which can be incorporated .
the future of bangladesh also depends on its youth .
however , i was unable to secure majorities here .
however , the commission can not tell member states to do that .
the belgian police refused to take that further evidence .
the alternative would be to take over control of the country , and no one wants that .
we would not be credible if we did not hold firm to this .
under due process of law , the judiciary is independent of the other authorities .
this would lead to more savings , including savings for taxpayers .
we must , of course , address the plague of cancer .
we have learned that the council passed a decision yesterday evening .
aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons .
once more , thanks for the support received from the rapporteur , mr caspary .
is anybody watching what they are doing ?
we must look at other possibilities , including partition and transmutation .
i am referring , of course , to the council of europe ' s european convention on human rights .
lastly , i should like to thank mrs   gebhardt again for the work she has done .
when will the institution begin its work ?
that is what we should be demanding .
that would contribute greatly to our political discussion .
madam president , i voted for the recommendation .
it does not limit the scope of our efforts .
it is a pity that in the case of genetically modified organisms the matter is not so obvious to everybody .
then we would not have a situation like this .
i regard that as a sign of respect for this house .
the treaty of amsterdam provides a more solid basis for union citizenship .
these reserves do not exist , which is just as well .
i invite you , in your own way , to show your solidarity by observing a minute 's silence .
thank you very much , commissioner .
question no 18 by ( h-0628/01 ) :
this will ensure its professionalism , effectiveness and unique character .
the rapid alert system should not , therefore , be placed under the control of the authority .
the failure to comply with the aforementioned provisions will nullify those efforts .
the timing and the deadlines do not militate against the acceptance of further amendments .
tour operators should be required to indicate which airlines are providing the flights .
... is not applied to people .
i would like to share some facts with the house this evening .
alzheimer 's disease affects everywhere equally .
in the context of the budget , we try to husband our resources carefully .
you referred to a summit coming up soon .
( de ) mr president , this is only about the correct name , about what is being referred to .
everyone knows perfectly well that that is not the case today .
the second issue has to do with impact assessment .
it is essential that consumers be informed and protected .
there is also a need to avoid public and private debt .
there are no contradictions in this report and in this revision of the daphne programme .
the fear of members , employees and the public should be taken seriously .
but what about parliament ' s priorities ?
they specifically mentioned the efsf and said that they were ready to reinforce it .
we have achieved a great deal .
harmonising all of this with national interests .
we now have to put our money where our mouth is .
this will prevent multiple asylum applications from being made in the eu and in liechtenstein .
we must take firm action against the potential counterfeiting of products which are wrongly labelled .
the rapporteurs actually acknowledge this in paragraph 9 of the document tabled before parliament .
the treaty brings the european union closer to its people .
. thank you for your comments .
( sk ) i ask myself , is the reform really about good wine ?
so you are welcome and congratulations !
if nothing is done , compulsory labelling will enter into force on 1 september 2000 .
i also support those colleagues who regard this as a global commitment .
this can be seen clearly in the current situation .
we are also appalled , however , at the attitude of the western powers , in particular the european ones .
question no 9 by brian crowley ( h-0236/03 ) :
we must make this possible and also defend their rights .
it is now or never .
my second point echoes what mr d'aboville said .
they talk repeatedly about the energy mix .
you can count on my personal commitment and on that of the college .
we have been able to do it in a fashion which we are quite happy with .
in germany , police surveillance in public places has been stepped up .
i can not back this .
at least this is how i understood it and this could be something positive .
the debate is closed .
( fr ) mr president , mrs paulsen , thank you for your report .
the evidence is that , today , europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials .
i had an opportunity to discuss this issue in mozambican rural communities .
parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted .
so my group will vote for the agreement today .
thank you for warning me .
that starts the week on a good note .
the debate on this agenda item is hereby closed .
i am not the only one in this house who knew of gebran tueni ; he was a leading political figure in lebanon .
10 . action plan on organ donation and transplantation ( 2009 - 2015 ) (
they must be allowed to remain together , so that they can practise their faith .
in spite of recent progress , the key issues remain untouched .
this is the gist of mr   schulz ’s amendment , to which mr   poettering has lent his support .
the commission can accept the following amendments in part : 17 , 27 , 59 , 142 and 158 .
in my view , a register of lobbyists is long overdue .
this is , of course , an erroneous claim .
he is sitting there , all you have to do is walk up to the public gallery and you can see him .
hence we urge the house to reject the report .
written statements ( rule 149 )
the commission can accept in part the following amendments : 33 , 45 and 47 .
the real stakes are these .
we must be clear : saddam hussein must be stopped .
mr   president , i should like to thank mrs   rothe for the report before us .
i would like to refer to the last one , the visa facilitation agreement .
eu citizens have no proper means of redress in the event of mistakes and abuse .
we shall continue with our efforts to convince developing countries in this matter .
the same is true of british and french enterprises investing abroad .
is the commission in possession of fresh data relating to east timor = s needs in the matter of support ?
that is usually the result of pressure on the part of others .
i just wanted to raise a point for future reference .
the third and final point relates to the restructuring of the committee on petitions .
how will it all work ?
it is not satisfactory to be done country by country .
mrs hautala has the floor , to speak in favour .
the rules of the club must be respected .
and , of course , that is just as it should be .
he would have killed far more than the 6 million jews .
i welcome this report because it will show us a way forward .
this , too , is now being left to the member states .
but how many people know about this ?
as the honourable member no doubt knows , the current direct talks concerning cyprus are confidential .
that is where the spam is coming from .
it has been compared to the 1992 single market programme .
not even a suggestion of an end to the opt - out was accepted .
it is developing much too slowly and on much too narrow a scale .
please , council , try again .
that is my political line , the same line as has been adopted by ireland : the results are there to be seen !
we do not base our policies on personal attacks .
thus , i can not support the report .
protection of workers from the risks of explosive atmospheres
a while ago , when voting began there were nearly 200 of us here .
the time has come , therefore , to listen ...
. ( pt ) sustainable development is at the very top of the international agenda .
we greens are often reproached as being busybodies .
i should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate .
certainly not the world , certainly not europe , not even our fellow meps .
too many of our top brains are leaving europe .
fourthly , we want to enhance the eu 's ability to act in the foreign policy domain .
i still had many things left to say .
the european commission 's policy needs to be reoriented .
i am voting in favour of bogusław liberadzki 's report on the inland transport of dangerous goods .
this is the exact point we are making .
my answer is - yes , it is .
more and more nuclear plants are being shut down .
only in this way is the member of parliament able to exercise control .
that is unacceptable .
we can no longer allow provision to be made for more development aid here .
i should like to congratulate her on the quality of her report .
all the preparatory legal steps to enable this to take place have already been taken .
however , the vehicle can not be used for commercial purposes in the netherlands .
but the reverse is true as well .
let us at least give a sign that we reject that mentality .
this is the only way to pursue budgetary policies that are responsible , truthful and transparent .
this is the situation in 2000 .
this question occupied us in committee for a very long time .
we shall resume the vote .
smes are dynamic and have a great ability to innovate and develop .
this is the best way , and we should promote it .
i would greatly appreciate your confirmation on this point .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
it should be mobilised faster .
we have to act and to protect ourselves .
( the house observed a minute ' s silence ) president .
serving two of the major sentences is , according to european standards , very cruel treatment .
nuts and locust beans
but , mr president , this is not how it is of course .
is it really up to us to regulate what other countries in the world get up to ?
but what is the future to be ?
the european parliament does not operate on a knee - jerk , reflex system .
that is a rather low level from him .
may i also say that what i propose is already quite normal in many member states .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
mr ioannis kasoulides
mr president , commissioner , thank you for this communication .
please tell me about it , because i have no such solution .
schmid report ( a4 - 0396/98 )
that is just the way things are , however .
what does this come down to ?
the european union certainly did not finance the cloning of dolly the sheep .
it is also a question of fairness for the people , both in the european union and also in india .
parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee
i would therefore ask you please to be quiet .
yet it is presented as the european union 's road map for the next 10 years .
that is the message we want to convey through this resolution .
yet , these same states today are not , in my view , being particularly reasonable .
this is initially an intra - community flight .
opinion polls would suggest that the majority of russians do have respect for the eu though .
thank you , commissioner .
a loan of eur 500 million will help ukraine come out of the financial crisis .
i should like to know the truth .
let us forget about galileo .
president ravalomanana lost support , and he stood down on 17 march 2009 .
mrs oomen - ruijten , you are absolutely right .
this needs to be resolved urgently .
the democratic deficit will increase , although the task was to reduce it .
it is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation .
bromate is to be found particularly in ozone - treated water .
although the intention may be good , the practical arrangements are more dubious .
i will mention five of them .
we had to show that the posts are not anyone ' s fixed prerogative . so we have made these ten changes which are , however , of fundamental importance .
here is mine :
the peace programme is justified as an internal matter for the eu .
all this seems to me to be completely incredible .
coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue .
the next item is a statement by the president - in - office of the council on the situation in kosovo .
but let me ask you what exactly is the situation ?
moldova is still living proof of this .
if it does not work , we can always amend the directive .
let us look at the first : commitments and approaches by member states .
that has not been addressed .
in any case , the referendum passed with just 54 % of the votes .
today is one of them .
think also of the european social conciliator .
given the circumstances , i think this is regrettable .
for a reform of that importance , is this really responsible ?
harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself .
we must reject the racist stereotype that regards them as a threat .
before the start of the vote
let us not waste time , when we have so little of it , and when we have so much to do .
this means that these manufacturers could just as easily use other materials .
( restrained applause )
in this respect , the european union is still waiting for real competences in sport .
mr president , politics is the art of the possible .
in writing . - ( it ) thank you , mr president .
we would like to take this opportunity to stress that we do not want residues of medicinal products in meat at all .
there is no specific community legislation governing gambling .
the poor population has to make do with emergency humanitarian aid .
if you will not leave , i will have you removed .
( parliament agreed to the request )
question no 10 by ( h-0969/01 ) :
we have to go to helsinki with this .
this calls for vision and conviction .
mrs ferrero - waldner , you have the floor .
the way in which he devotes himself to his work is unequalled .
china was number two on the eu 's trade partners list in 2007 .
even if this is harsh , at least it has the merit of being clear .
we are unable to accept amendment no 12 on sound level limits .
that is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time .
i do not think this kind of resolution does any credit to our parliament .
that was not right .
in fact , two commissioners .
our range of concerns about relations with taiwan also falls into this category .
they scored a partial success at the itu conference .
we have now taken the decision to declare ' peace with nature ' .
but it is equally true that attack is the best form of defence .
this parliament should realise that these people need special treatment .
approximately a million people have been displaced in acholiland and in the lango and iteso regions .
this is the best way to avoid excesses .
so we are now placing great hope and expectations in the announced white paper .
how does one define the concept of maladministration ?
i know people are calling for it .
just one further point .
we are pleased to note the opening of the internal audit unit .
it was not the case and hence i did not object .
he has inherited a house , which he sells for dm 1 million .
15 . implementing measures ( level 2 ) of the prospectus directive ( vote )
commissioner , we clashed swords ; we disagreed on several points .
eu policy with regard to these regions is outdated .
the distress of british farmers is quite understandable .
eaggf : 26th financial report
this must not be allowed to happen .
the second paragraph has caused the most controversy and reads :
it is just taxpayers ' money we are dealing with .
there is much for us to do there , too .
the suggestion by mr staes is one of the suggestions which are currently being tabled .
we have to have an active policy to meet their concerns and aspirations .
madam president , you will be very welcome in the basque country .
not all languages are in fact equal in the eu in this respect .
even in shelter programmes women are involved .
now , we have to wait .
for its part , the european parliament must become more actively involved in promoting creativity as a driving force for innovation .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the situation in gaza .
all these sorts of affairs are going to have to be better organised .
this would be impractical , unnecessary and disproportionate .
a typical family with a father , mother and two children will be paying dkk 11 000 on an annual basis .
we will not be voting for amendment 6 , not even as an addition , because its effect will be harmful .
we can , all the same , acknowledge that safety will win out here .
to approve it today would mean endorsing a completely different policy .
i therefore assume that the number of complaints will increase .
the commission has also done good work on the drafting of the interim report and on its presentation .
once we have done that - and it will not be easy - then the emissions trading scheme must be developed further .
mr president , i should like to welcome mrs diamantopoulou here this afternoon .
this is a crucial political issue that we have not yet debated .
i would like just to pick up on two or three of the key areas that were discussed .
i have no problem in following it as well .
they did not use the internet enough .
the report is commendable .
the debate is closed .
in writing . - ( sk ) i would like to speak on a very personal note .
there are three demands : transparency , monitoring and vigilance .
the european union is a community of values .
firstly , i should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur .
it has been a true privilege to be in the very engine - house of european integration .
what does this all mean for our fishermen ?
( the president briefly cut off the speaker )
i welcome your commitment to the substance of the constitutional text .
they do not want a free ride .
( ga ) mr president , i welcome the response of the president - in - office of the council .
i will briefly respond to mr barón crespo .
the debate is closed .
it is now important for the osce to be present as quickly as possible .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
statements of both these kinds envisage a situation involving two parties .
neither is it very european .
when can we in parliament expect to receive its draft proposals for a legislative framework ?
we , the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left , demand that the arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot .
this must be posted not in small print , but clearly and explicitly .
to such a proposal , i categorically say no .
let me make a comment on galileo .
it is increased unemployment and the wider gaps that it entails .
they need our solidarity .
clear messages have emerged from the public consultation on this point .
from now on then the amount of work that is done on this new theme as of this year is in your hands .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the alternative is clear .
question no 51 by ( h-0081/01 ) :
and what does the commission do ?
your second criterion for targeting is labour - intensive services .
we propose first of all to improve the payments .
we believe this is best practice .
these are world stocks for everyone , and first of all also for those countries .
can you let us know what timetable you are working to and who is responsible ?
( de ) many thanks , madam president , many thanks , commissioner .
there will certainly be individual items with which we may disagree .
the car is in danger of collapsing !
let me give you the historical background again .
i should like to say how fondly i think of you .
for the individuals involved , it is restricting the free movement of labour .
there is no connection between private players in the gambling market and match - fixing .
kathalijne buitenweg can not be here , but i will represent her views .
that is why it is becoming a stable environment for democracy .
in my view , it is the citizens of europe who are the winners .
mr president , let me begin by welcoming this debate .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
the report is based on two assumptions .
the founding fathers understood this and established europe as a community based on the rule of law .
thanks to her once again .
moreover , the general description of the area of application that has been given is too vague .
i see that mrs   in’t   veld has a point of order .
but does the european union count as much as it should in the world ?
thank you for your support for the resolution .
eighteen countries contributed their experience .
2011 will be a decisive year .
however , we are quite active in this field also .
this year , the exact same thing is happening with the european freight corridors .
how many member states have visited projects in other member states ?
children 's rights and their protection call for an integrated policy .
defining europe ’s role in the globalised world as regards migration ?
all this makes the financial regulation a great success .
i nevertheless welcome what president prodi has said .
( thank you mr president .
a few years ago we had the white paper on growth , competitiveness and employment .
i am convinced that this objective has already been achieved .
the commission reiterates this in its decision .
i therefore strongly urge support for my amendment on the continuous monitoring of the list .
the commission will not drop that idea .
the onus of proof continues to be on those who wish to do these things .
however , it is important that we do not restrict innovation to research and technology .
now we have to go through that sensitive area .
mr cabrol 's amendments meet this safety requirement .
i could almost say it is a matter of days rather than weeks .
please tell that to commissioner mandelson .
however , such a system has made the inspection process somewhat more cumbersome .
i appeal to all of you not to block the road to further development .
mr president , it is the year 2005 .
echo is going to continue . this is clearly part of what we have decided .
for that reason , it is quite natural that the union should want a more open market for the world economy also .
what people want is information , commissioner , and you should therefore be more open in your dealings with this house .
the problem we are talking about is a real one .
the debate is closed .
the house is sending out a clear message .
they are all indispensable for women 's full enjoyment of their human rights .
the process leading to agreement was a comprehensive and inclusive one .
in order to achieve this , we need a budget .
13 . macro - financial assistance to bosnia and herzegovina (
that is an important contribution . i want to thank the minister of the council .
either way , retail food prices can only go higher .
does that group wish to explain its proposal ?
there is a lot of work to be done there and we need to start doing it .
you may not like it -
sort that out , and everything will be fine .
everyone will complain and europe will not have made any progress .
obviously this refers to fires , but the solidarity fund covers flooding .
it is not for parliament to legislate on flight time limitations .
mr maaten , the rapporteur , wanted , and still wants , to abolish this directive .
if we analyse the report , it is clearly demonstrated that we have advanced since then .
where then is the coordination that might perhaps be still justified ?
one member put it very eloquently : illegal migration , it is a problem .
it also shows that the so - called environmental guarantee is , for the most part , propaganda .
but it is , as you know , nine years , plus two years , plus one year .
i should , for that reason therefore , like to withdraw the amendment .
you always need to consider what would happen if we can not achieve anything and the constitutional treaty fails .
groundhandling at airports
we just need to get on with it before natural selection catches up .
euro - mediterranean interim association agreement with plo- middle east peace process
that is something that can still be decided .
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
it is important that this declaration is in the protocol and has been heard .
we need to very careful about that .
we owe this to our citizens .
i therefore consider cooperation between these officers and frontex to be urgently necessary .
- the debate is closed .
approval of the minutes
between 1980 and 2000 , there were 250 000 typhoon victims .
i would also like to thank mr colom i naval for the work that he has done relating to this matter .
are you prepared , commissioner , to draft a substantive discussion document of that kind ?
at the end of june a new eu - russia agreement is finally to be negotiated in siberia .
i think and fear that this is the case with the study we are looking at today .
the commission has an important role to play in relation to european law in that regard .
we must therefore look very carefully before we leap .
the precautionary principle must apply .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
we have not been negotiating but are continuing to explore the us position .
these are the normal conditions .
it has happened to me so many times : i get up there and i can not see a thing !
( the oral amendment was not accepted . )
having said that , i would ask parliament to remember what is on the table .
we have no uniform right to vote .
firstly , recognition .
so who is this to be ?
eu forests and other wooded land cover more than 42 % of the eu 's surface area .
we wish to take a bold step forward with monetary policy .
following the disasters , the countries in question requested assistance from the eusf .
such a thing should not be tolerated or permitted in this house .
but to what extent are these funds used ?
i try to encourage them , but i can not force them .
war will never lead to peace .
i believe that the whole system should be phased out as soon as possible .
that is the first thing i wanted to say .
so it does not fall into mrs wulf - mathies ' remit .
i also feel that , overall , it does not contain anything excessive or disproportionate .
it is essential to ensure accurate verification and recording of trans - shipments and landings .
the palestinian people did not vote in favour of hamas , it voted against fatah .
( the president proposed that the question be answered in writing )
to close , i should also like to thank the rapporteur , mr   lipietz , for his excellent report .
these were unanimous decisions of all 27 member states .
several problems arise in this connection , such as the following .
the repatriation of refugees has begun .
the commission will approve it when this phase has been completed .
as early as 1995 it was therefore decided to abolish it .
however , i am still not entirely satisfied .
it is in those terms that we appeal to you .
mr president , thank you for your very kind words .
the third issue is social inclusion , which is one of the integrated guidelines .
it is essential to simplify legislation .
we all know what troubles the citizens .
this was also evident from the figures .
what i would like to know is : what are we giving priority to ?
i am delighted to see that commissioner rehn is moving in that direction .
i find that unacceptable .
it is with enthusiasm that i voted in favour of this text .
this is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective .
human weaknesses have continued to play a role in japan right up to the present .
we want to really see blanket coverage .
there is a range of challenges here which we can only meet together .
my second message is about syria .
there is , in fact , no urgency because the money would be released for august .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
that is further justification for harmonising the rules in the member states .
i applaud the report 's call for even greater transparency within the european institutions .
these , mr president of the commission , are bills of exchange on the future .
our decision to reject the text is final .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
the analysis of the report raises certain critical questions .
– b5 - 0450/03 tabled by john bowis and others , on behalf of the ppe - de group ;
we intend that they should continue to do so .
i told him that he spoke like karl marx in exile .
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .
we support a radical reform of the sugar sector within the eu .
the commission itself has proposed it , and we all know that special measures are needed .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
it is a pity i can not say the same for some of his other colleagues .
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
some of those suggestions are either being addressed or are in the pipeline .
the train is at a standstill , and to stand still is to regress .
i applaud the report and the committee 's proposals .
we did not succeed in nice , but we do not intend to give up .
this is a point on which we must be clear , dispensing with ambiguity .
water is a scarce and precious natural resource .
i therefore continue to look forward to the copenhagen european council with great optimism .
we will therefore conclude questions to the council and thank him for being here .
that is necessary and right .
who is defending europe 's interests ? helmut kohl has been doing that , and for many years .
what , then , are the main subjects we need to discuss ?
that applies especially to the possibility of banning various flame retardants .
however , the people of augustavas want to live quietly .
that this has been cut to six months since may this year represents a massive step forward .
the commission took initiatives .
i will therefore abstain when it comes to the vote .
the council does not have to instruct us .
i went on to the internet the other day to find out about the competition day that is coming up .
that concludes questions to the commission .
1 . allegation of mass graves in indian - administrated kashmir
the climate in the european union , the business climate , and also ethics and environment .
he lives quite literally in fear of his life , a fact demonstrated by the murder of president rabin .
the item is hereby closed .
therefore we need to integrate policies on a horizontal and vertical plane .
we will , of course , take good account of the observations you have made .
it is important that the general public should become aware of this debate .
( parliament approved the request to postpone the vote )
i can not say more than that at this point .
it is sufficient to say that the resolution has been adopted by a broad majority .
i think there must be more vigilance in future .
was the united states saved because of its police force or federal intelligence system ?
the euro will only exist if the people have faith in their currency .
the one opportunity that is being neglected is tidal power .
it is superfluous and that is why it was not put to a vote .
communication of council common positions : see minutes
the bureau is going to deal with this issue again at its meeting today .
this seems to us to be an effective guarantee against social dumping .
we would like to see women in as many committee positions as possible .
slandering the gods was punished with the death penalty .
i warn you of this , mr president , in consideration of the 2000 budget .
they went far beyond the call of duty .
mr barroso in particular could not have been clearer on this issue .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
these are very noble and correct economic objectives for us to set our hands and our shoulders to .
there are also a large number of jobs concentrated there - in the eu , in third countries and worldwide .
if we do not distinguish between the two we will never resolve the issue of pensions .
still we have not received them .
the debate is closed .
undoubtedly , both the commission and parliament play a part .
in order to keep older people working , payments will be paid to the young unemployed .
this is what makes subsidiarity so important .
how , in international law , can a government deport one of its own citizens ?
that is not the aim of the legislation .
this report proposes nothing new in terms of saving our jobs .
and during this time , the animals exceeded their optimum weight .
mr president , the ultra - peripheral regions suffer from the handicap of remoteness .
he himself will not be too happy with the list he has submitted .
that is a lacuna we ought to do something about .
the next item is the joint debate on :
is it not there that we should be looking for weapons of mass destruction ?
( the oral amendment was rejected )
her newspaper has also been punished and has been closed down for three months as a result of that article .
i am the budget draftsman of the committee on development .
the second case concerned lufthansa and sas .
i find the wording with regard to the usa particularly good .
mr goodwill has the floor for a procedural motion .
this has been the case partly because there has not been a sufficiently pluralist debate in the media .
embassies of eu member states could play a more supervisory role in situ .
this has not yet been officially confirmed but i believe it to be the case .
how can we be discussing torture and the fight against it in this subcommittee ?
we surely can not take this seriously .
with a measure of good will , that could have been done .
proactive thinking on human rights is regrettably selective in the eu .
as i am sure you know , at that time the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats abstained in the vote in the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities .
depending on how our work goes , we will see whether we are more or less productive .
space will be ever more present in all aspects of people ’s daily lives .
this figure is already included in a number of regulations .
today , in 2008 , we are facing a challenge every bit as important .
commission decisions are subject to an advisory committee procedure .
however , most farms produce for their own needs rather than for the market .
this situation has obviously now changed .
it is on this basis alone that a united europe has a future .
i recommend voting in favour of this report .
you have those who are against the constitution but for enlargement .
this is also normal , for they are most familiar with their own issues .
an expert has made an assessment of this agreement .
subject : discrepancies in healthcare in the member states
it does not have one with the people 's republic of china , which has been mentioned , or with vietnam .
this word replaces ' authority ' .
having said that , many questions remain open .
their application should become a rule , not an object of political bargaining .
this would allow for tolerance in respect of and by any religion .
the outcome of the referendum and the terrible consequences were very predictable .
thank you very much , commissioner van den broek .
i am most anxious for a permanent solution to be found to prevent further disruption .
these days , of course , everyone has their experts .
certainly not if you look at what we spend on it .
we were a kind of life - raft in europe , and we still are today .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report .
thank you very much for the answer even if i am none the wiser .
we do not know what to do with the nuclear waste from this project .
i should therefore like to warn you against such simplistic proposals , which will get us nowhere .
swamping consumers with information does not help them .
three fundamental considerations in this report should be emphasized .
this is in the interest of consumer protection .
it has therefore never been suggested that the measure is not a useful one .
( the sitting was opened at 9.00 a.m. )
there is greater need for the project at present than ever before .
first , do we need this observatory at all ?
we know we have considerable problems apart from in the area of the transatlantic business dialogue .
i wish those who are going into retirement all the very best for their retirement .
i could speak about this issue for a long time .
they are not declaring themselves for europe and against the united states - emphatically not .
the debate is closed .
for the rest , the citizens must control the state , not the other way around .
this is what we are calling on the commission to do .
that is no longer possible today .
let me briefly repeat the key points .
protection of families and children
the second reason is because we should not discriminate .
but let us look beyond the borders of the european union .
. i can only say that i agree .
secondly , there are the issues relating to technological innovation and applied research .
it should have done so .
i am voting in favour . is there anyone who will be against ?
employees in the eu deserve better .
the next item is the commission statement on the situation of the refugee camps in malta .
mr   president , have not the sudanese people suffered long enough ?
we can not , however , afford to have such a situation in europe any longer .
transfers of appropriations : see minutes
in europe , there are more than one hundred peoples and more than one hundred different languages .
but we have to agree something at this stage .
moreover , national parliaments also have such an instrument .
europe 's demography requires immigration .
similarly , we consider eurobonds to be a sensible and , thus , also a necessary instrument .
it took time for the council to realise this , however .
we have an agreement with canada and russia .
therefore , the council did not have the right to make the aforementioned decision .
the ppe group supports it here as it did in the case of the ewc , and we are still hoping for the pse group 's agreement .
that is what we must be aware of , once and for all .
it is time that we internationalised some of them .
the future enlargement of the union is only one of such challenges .
thank you , commissioner byrne .
this principle will remain unchanged after the reform and poland is no exception to this rule .
2 . basel ii and revision of the capital requirements directive ( crd 4 ) (
in that sense what we do here in the european parliament is also of great value and significance .
so is a high - level infrastructure .
it is important that we have dissuasive and reactive mechanisms .
it makes it virtually impossible for us and is not a fair procedure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in eritrea is escalating by the day .
5 . optional protocol to the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
the industry and the principle contractor involved are multinationals .
joint action is an important complement to the convention .
the draft was to be put forward in the third quarter of 2011 .
the ambitious europe 2020 programme was adopted unanimously last july by the european council .
we need an effective european employment policy .
models should be built showing what a city in the cultured network society should be like .
this is a difficult moment for europe .
even if only a quarter of what he said is true , the situation is extremely problematical .
in 1993 the un general assembly adopted a declaration on the abolition of violence against women .
i believe it is our task to wake it .
all the stamps that need to be paid for , all the documents that have to be submitted .
we are therefore relying on his stated commitment to bring it forward .
i believe we should urge them to exceed the 25 % .
comenius , the section for schools , funded 15 000 schools with over 2 million pupils .
for example , my own country sweden has in the past been a very egalitarian country .
thank you mr president .
it is important that the european union speak in the international arena with one voice .
ladies and gentlemen , the migration and asylum policy is an issue for the future .
the uk has such a threshold .
this is a blind alley and we must find a different way forward .
new rule 79a of the rules of procedure
( fr ) madam president , vice - president of the commission , you are right .
topical and urgent debate ( objections )
this does not simply mean stopping the bombs that give rise to hatred ; we also have to develop a new concept of europe , one that is applicable to the whole of the continent .
in 1970 , europe used 4.2 % of its gdp for public investments .
we shall , of course , look into the matter thoroughly .
i shall make you a few proposals , most of which have not yet been given any consideration .
does the commissioner agree with amendment no 23 or not ?
unfortunately , our current policy has not brought the expected results .
but when i say no more walls , i also mean , indeed i particularly mean , that existing walls must be torn down .
on behalf of my group , i ask you to support it when we vote tomorrow .
so we will be having a constructive dialogue , madam president .
i therefore ask you to inform the president , so that i may be answered .
it is a serious problem which has to be solved .
none of us in this house know where it will end and what that end will bring .
the question of currencies is a totally unrelated matter to the investigation under wto rules .
the european citizens of galicia would like to receive exactly the same treatment .
i shall be supporting the position of the french government on three points .
it is not accepted because of the need to focus on the key issues today .
the report draws the only possible conclusion - we must become more flexible .
young children need three to four pairs of new shoes per year .
we really should prepare for that impact .
social action programme 1998 - 2000
i would like to thank the president - in - office for his rapid and efficient response .
you can only ask one supplementary question during the course of question time .
in particular , the promotion policy of the economic and social committee requires careful scrutiny .
the united states and russia have just signed a joint nuclear research agreement .
well , here again we are lagging behind .
the problem is that milosevic knows what he wants and is doing exactly what he wants .
it is a black hole .
it is an important tool in the fight against violence .
this must therefore result in greater commitment from both parties .
we do not need to be powerless , however : we can do quite a lot .
it is important that the commission shows how this is to be done .
at global level , women are poor by comparison with men .
our society has changed .
we must take action .
what are they , faced with a commission president such as this one , actually meant to think ?
it is also worth giving some thought to the reasons behind these dangerous occurrences .

what you want is for the commission to renounce its responsibilities .
this undoubtedly brings many benefits , but there are also many drawbacks .
it is the recommendation of the rapporteur to reject the commission proposal .
the eib continues to be , from our perspective , an institution which it is not possible to supervise .
much was said about the environment .

we have to target roma as voters and as candidates at all political levels .
i consider it positive and fair that sarajevo be european capital of culture .
there must be consequences , and they must be consequences that make themselves felt .
( de ) mr president , the aim is to standardise the right to asylum within the eu by 2012 .
social policy involves more !
the debate is closed .
i also have a concern to express and a request to make .
the importance of the zone of competence of the wcpfc to the community fleet speaks for itself .
there has been a specific procedure for questionnaires in the past .
in the context of these complex multilateral discussions , that is not a very long time .
thank you very much for your cooperation , mr lamy .
while i was there on the delegation i visited a coalmine and a thermal power station .
i will say however to him that the new aid programme , in fact , is conditional .
why should it be abandoned ?
the issue would cause a heated debate even in parliament .
there is no determination , no ambition , but , unfortunately , that does not surprise me any more .
no wonder that the eu is not taken seriously .
trading is not permitted under marpol annex vi .
there is also a shortage of pedagogical material at schools .
19 . priorities for the 2011 budget - section iii - commission (
at that time , finland and sweden , for example , were not members of the european union .
rather than voting ‘ no’ , i should perhaps have simply left the room .
for that reason , it will be necessary to give additional support to legislative work .
to this end , a substantial increase in south - south trade is required .
this is a crucial question which mrs theorin has raised .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
space will always be an engine of industrial innovation .
something of a rethink is called for here .
the polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .

eu - africa summit ( cairo , 3 and 4 april 2000 )
could we have done more ?
the commission has adopted some of parliament 's amendments .
we should feel the full weight of our responsibilities .
in its new form , it could provide an answer to the current gridlock .
let us ensure that our resolve does not falter and thereby weaken theirs !
this was not done in nice , it was done in secret .
action taken on eib annual report
therefore i think the lambert report is unacceptable on that basis .
thank you very much , mr wijsenbeek .
all three have their particular value and something special to contribute .
it is amendment no 2 . but i would like the commission to confirm this .
it is a partnership of negation and blockade !
mr president , ' top that ! ' is a saying in england .
i utterly abhor this scandal - mongering .

let me finish with these remarks .
so why was that not possible ?
vice - president of the commission . - i am sorry .
it strengthens the institutional power of the union .
the european system would therefore have automatic self - regulation .
in any case , i personally did not observe the result , but the machine deems it to be correct , and the result stands as i have just announced it .
a great many people find it very hard to provide such proof .
five thousand lobbyists out of the 15 000 operating in brussels have access to the european parliament .
a compromise is still possible , however .
ensuring protection of this right is just as important as judicial regulation of the matter .
however , the crisis has hit this sector hard .
nor does this material spring to eye immediately .
put all the documents from the entire legislation process on the website .
we now know that the commitment i have just set out is possible .

it would do well , today , to follow its own advice .
i believe that i have found in them a lot of common ground with my own views .
no wonder london is widely dubbed ' londonistan ' .
people are not sufficiently aware of this .

why maximum harmonisation ?
there are only men , even though women took part in the demonstrations .

8 . european rail network for competitive freight (
congratulations on a truly solid piece of work !
so far even war criminals have been treated less harshly by the serbian judiciary .

justice goldstone did not show sufficient care when examining the evidence .
it was not just a quick question of any one person saying ' this is the position ' .
next the share of the budget taken by the report is unbalanced .
that does not make it any easier to assess this commission as a whole .
at the same time , however , we must be practical and realistic .
what is happening about baby food ?
the statement concludes : ' we must stop the aggressive war on iraq .
this raises the point of your 500 non - permanent posts , which we are going to have to examine in detail .
mr president , as we are short of time i will make my statement telegram style .
we can not compare an umbrella organisation with organisations that work individually .
mr president , thank you .
firstly , there is the need for more effective action against organised crime , fraud and corruption .
as you can see , mrs banotti , you still have your work cut out for you .
the commission 's report presents the economic situation in the eurozone in 2007 .
the human body is not patentable ; only products created by man can be patentable .
and all that time i thought the commissioner was out there trying to save the world !
this is happening on a country - by - country basis .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
first of all , media freedom : overall , there is a lack of media pluralism .
it is of interest to us too .
earthquake in turkey
however , we are also all aware that we are on the right track .
the financing of the eit is now the key outstanding issue .
large amounts of this gas are found in france , poland and bulgaria .
however , my worry remains with the players ' associations .
learn from our mistakes .

mr president , this is a subject we could fruitfully discuss for a long time yet .
i welcome this and thank the committee on budgets .
and then some other group will come along demanding something else .
this is an important message which the summit should convey .
what is required in order to promote combined heat and power ?
we have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors .
secondly , the importance of transport .
this is a great innovation .
this will clear the way for those wishing to travel by rail to be able to do so .
in the case of gozo , malta 's sister island , we have a scenario of double insularity .
we would be delighted to welcome him there .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
a europe where liberalisation does not mean the liquidation of public services .
some take nearly double the time allotted .
so we need to direct our attention in the right sort of way .
we are talking about freedom , security and justice : three fundamental principles .
what should the key points be ?
the choice of government is a matter for the people of israel .
there are also advertisements warning of the illeffects of tobacco .
mr daul has the floor .
with enlargement , there also comes the demand for an eu charter of fundamental rights .
however , it is women , and not men , who are discriminated against in this way .
on this depend the future of europe , its independence , its growth and employment in it .
only 26 % of the french have confidence in this artificial currency .
.     thank you , mr   president .
we will discuss these later .
consequently we europeans must focus our attention more on the population itself .
this was signed on 30 november 2009 .
this solution is very important for cases of lower and fragmented damages .
the a74 will attract many extra lorries , which are major polluters .
i see this as an improvement on the text of the common position .
president of the commission . - i would like to thank graham watson for this very important question .
set aside is good for the agricultural industry , so we should take on board a pesc - aside for the fishing industry .
in poland , that is about 6.5 million people .
the adverse effects are already visible .
in austria , for example , 7 % of the budget is spent on the railways .
the sugar sector is also affected by this .
however , i agree with the previous speaker : let us roll up our sleeves and get on with it .
traceability is essential .
i am thinking of the europol data , the schengen data and the eurodac data .
i do not want to see consumer protection distorted into protectionism .
we have to have certainty in that , but there is certainly no fear of us having referendums .
i , for one , would certainly not want to be on that flight .
we need a mixture of legislative and market - based responses .
the discussion on employment in cardiff was excellent .
zappalà report ( a5 - 0379/2001 )
this is crucial above all in terms of identifying areas at risk and drawing up packages of measures .
mr president , i congratulate you .
this links in with my own report , as i mentioned earlier .
the european parliament has proved to be extremely cooperative .
what will the commission do in its external action to promote this participation ?
the cost is ecu 500 million per year but i am not going to talk about this as it could be resolved if necessary .
i am pleased that this need is being increasingly recognised .
1   january 2007 is an achievable date for bulgaria ’s accession to the european union .
mr president , i would just like to add a word to the same effect .
the european council in helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new member states .
first , we have to introduce a major programme of investment in energy conservation in europe .
women 's organisations play an essential role in the fight against violence .
the fact that the legal act is not yet available is regrettable and is already having repercussions .
mr president , i wish to follow on from what mrs doyle has said .
why not include the internal market in the five objectives ?
is there a speaker against ?
at the time , the european community was powerless .
you do not need a lot of money to teach skills like this and others .
perhaps we can make some progress .
recommendation for second reading of the bouwman report ( a5 - 0043/2000 )
the community will have to continue its efforts to contribute to the eradication of this blight .
personal safety is at least as important .
the rising consumption by young people is especially worrying .
an equal amount must be spent on critical media coverage .
so i really would urgently ask you to answer these two questions .
unfortunately , feelings of fear , conservatism and protectionism have pervaded the whole of this debate .
it is essential that this is implemented in full .
my country , for example , is not one of the favoured countries in terms of quotas .
that would not be a more equitable system .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 a.m.
none of this is acceptable in its current form .
as the author is not present , question no 17 lapses .
it should also make it difficult for companies to brand their products in a misleading way .
this is the proposal which was included in the rules for participation .
financial supervision ( signing of acts )
this is what experience tells us .
i ask that they conclude them promptly and refer them to parliament .
we have several european programmes that provide incentives .
firstly , the parliament budget .
no other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as colombia .
the reform of european fisheries policy simply will not wait .
on 12 august 2002 , he was abducted in makhachkala , the capital of dagestan .
they just needed time and space to think and conduct research .
voting time ( continuation )
- before the vote on the heading above paragraph 1 :
public debate is certainly the biggest flaw of democracy .
it would be wonderful if our resolution led to results now .
that concludes the vote .
pricing policies are not transparent and they apply to no more than 40 % of world trade .
your heart is in the right place , but we want results .
so the result does not reflect the financial priorities of parliament .
after all , europe is there for everyone .
in my view systems of mutual recognition are more attractive .
this may also prevent a brain drain in europe .
a return to democracy is as difficult as ever .
this fear is even expressed in a working paper from such an authoritative source as the oecd itself .
we may be waiting so long that we are unable to hold our debate at all .
full cooperation with icty remains a requirement .
it is now essential to ensure that they are fulfilled .
article 31 welcomes the police raid on a weapons cache .
we always visualise the very large companies and have little sympathy for them .
we are amazed , let me repeat , that they should be so surprised .
we are addressing many demands to the commission today .
i see mr jørgensen is here , and i want to pass some comments about the way this parliament has worked .
capital is the most difficult thing to tax as it is mobile .
it must lead on to further efforts to remove the obstacles .
last but not least , we can go along with what has been negotiated .
those regions must be taken into consideration .
thank goodness for that and i am glad to see such wisdom .
this is not enough .
we have always , each one of us , listened to its concerns .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
the right to development is being denied to many .
unfortunately , this inspired policy comes too late , far too late .
i very much support this proposition .
this can , however , only be done if the other financing options have been considered .
in fact , this course of action corresponds to the wishes of the majority of the population .
economics , aesthetics and technology are in symbiosis with one another .
these seem to me to be very important points .
my report would , i am sure , go some way to reassuring people .
in conclusion , i would briefly like to address mrs merkel .
this is why we are , actually , in a kind of virtual debate and are doing silly things to boot .
mr skinner will speak about this in a moment .
leonardo da vinci programme ( 1995 - 1999 )
we have a majority in favour of this view in denmark .
mr president , more and more europeans live in cities .
secondly , a certain quota per member state , shared between long - fibre and short - fibre flax and hemp .
maybe we should think quite carefully about what happens in the arctic .
10 . temporary provisions concerning rates of vat ( vote )
the ad hoc procedure occupies an important place in the budgetary process as regards agricultural spending .
the first was the development of the economic pillar of economic and monetary union .
question no 13 by alexandros alavanos ( h-0369/02 ) :
i will vote for nearly everything contained in his proposal .
that applies not merely to the candidate countries but also to the developing countries .
thank you in advance for your help , mr president .
it is a similar situation with social policy .
it is true that the security situation is still fragile .
our fellow citizens undoubtedly value vigilant management of financial resources .
the commission generally has the utmost difficulty in getting european directives moving .
the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities has taken up this issue on many occasions .
mr president , something is not quite right .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
the issue of the union 's external representation is also relevant to economic affairs .
development problems in italy
this approach is particularly important for ' at risk ' groups .
we reject this pointless exercise .
marco polo is a positive move but , on its own , it is clearly nowhere near enough .
pakistan will benefit from the new gsp from january 2006 .
unfortunately , however , it is not mentioned in the commission 's decision today .
i voted against this cover for speculation .
it applies generally to the functioning of the commission .
that is the aim of the platform of memory and conscience .
wednesday and thursday ( unaltered )
i am thinking of the supervision agreement and the green paper on the governance of financial institutions .
the spirit of galileo is with us today .
during our visit we met representatives of amis , the african union mission in sudan .
for anything that is aimed at minimising the damage , there is a very small amount left over .
this will be a cartel , and to face this cartel we need stricter laws .
to date , this has mainly affected the sectors that are labour - intensive and need little technology .
the answer is certainly no .
the future blacklists may also be seen in connection with the certificates of origin .
that is 11 000 people !
the contents of the agreement are completely unacceptable .
we will refer the matter to the linguistic services .
moreover , when mrs kratsa went to marseille , we gave her a lot of support on this issue .
meps love voting for texts .
simplified , uniform legislation is required for all member states .
i voted in favour of this resolution .
it was said that this was one of the most important tasks that we face in the coming years .
we must see the present crisis as an opportunity to make improvements .
10 . the placing of plant protection products on the market ( vote )
we shall interrupt the debate to proceed to the votes .
it is an odd matter that we have to fix .
we have no unitary mechanism for intervention in case of an earthquake .
we have negotiated good compromises on these points .
the cappato report proposes that the opt - out system could also be adopted .
third criterion : the search of a more transparent union .
it must , thirdly , be clear to us that development has progressed further .
uzbekistan- b5 - 0621/2001 by mr haarder , on behalf of the eldr group ;
the debate is closed .
however , the citizens themselves do not seem to be aware of that .
you are right that not everybody knows about them .
otherwise it will build its own fleet and the overall global fleet will simply increase .
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
i am delighted with your response .
national minorities in ukraine are in danger , they are afraid and they are calling for help .
of course , we can only denounce these acts of violence and vandalism .
it can bring enormous benefits to the human race in general and increase prosperity for all of us .
we in the european union have adopted new legislation .
instead , we have seen half - truths , prevarication and evasion .
this principle should not be lost through eu coordination .
the fact remains that , at present , monitoring is primarily the responsibility of the member states .
the eu budget should be drawn up in conjunction with the european political agenda .
we will all be winners .
– thank you for being so understanding , mrfabra vallés .
its consumption is linked to 30 % of all cancers .
we europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country .
in the final analysis , it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans .
this is a proposal the greens have always put forward .
i can assure you that we take such incidents quite as seriously as they deserve .
we have ensured that damage to materials is included amongst the criteria for consideration .
this is something on which i shall expand when i speak on the report by mrs sanders - ten holte .
we are talking about human life .
i commend the resolution unamended to the house .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate has been most instructive .
i believe that the member states must adopt a serious approach .
this is no longer the case .
madam president , i strongly support mr blokland 's report .
an opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act .
listen instead to public opinion in poland .
it is the supreme value .
question no 34 by ( h-0578/01 ) :
it is an intrinsically political act , and a politically important one .
secondly , mr president , the budget .
it has been announced and the figures are there .
i sincerely hope agreement can be reached on alpine transit .
even if this is , in the meantime , slowly beginning to change , there still remains a lot to do .
i take the liberty of drawing attention to a further point .
all the rest must be entrusted to funding mechanisms .
what action could we take in response ?
i now move to the issue of togo .
there is a need to be able to react faster than the current structure allows .
why , therefore , is it the case that we in parliament are not looking at that ?
there are a few comments i should like to make .
parliament takes the control function assigned to it in the european treaties seriously .
and , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .
what do we propose ?
and then it would be curtains for the rule of law !
the format of this parliamentary delegation remains special and unique .
mr president , i find mrs roth - behrendt 's generosity quite amazing .
we are talking about respecting resolution   1244 passed in 1999 .
admittedly , their success was not unalloyed , but it is worth emphasising what was achieved .
they must comply with increasingly complex systems .
congratulations and well done .
the debate is closed .
a marsh will produce roughly the same amount of peat in a year as a forest does wood pulp per unit area .
that will do , or i shall not let you have the floor .
nevertheless , a few comments need to be made here .
i feel that it is very important that third countries are included in this resolution .
i only hope that this report really is adopted , and adopted by a large majority .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
what do we do about someone who is unemployed but undergoing training ?
these are facts , statistics .
madam president , what mrs jensen is saying is terrible .
in spite of this , the subject of food safety is high up on the agenda .
the most important objectives which the commission had already envisaged are entirely reasonable .
the common agricultural policy is much too wasteful and bureaucratic .
you have our greatest respect for that .
we are complying with that .
the initial work started in 2007 .
hence it is a bad thing that reforms in the milk products sector are not to take effect until 2005 .
you are aware of this too , as you have had the findings on your desk since september .
firstly , there were no major new spending programmes in the 1997 budget .
the second point is the idea of added therapeutic value for a new medicinal product .
it should be seen for what it is .
parliament must make it quite clear to the council of europe that there can be no way round this .
. let me assure the honourable member that we are engaged in constructive negotiations .
i would appreciate hearing what the commissioner has to say on this area of tension .
new as far as the doha meeting was concerned was the appearance of the group of 21 nations .
we therefore voted against the report .
however , europe can not , under any circumstances , stand aside and do nothing .
the debate concerns the economic situation , the monetary situation and the social situation .
therefore , only a simple majority is needed for this document to be adopted .
regulation of european securities markets ( continuation )
i shall pass the question on to the commissioner responsible .
when will european forces advance into chad , as promised for last summer ?
what are the specific steps we intend to take ?
there really have to be some changes here .
what is there to be done ?
israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of gaza .
how will they avoid a similar crisis in the future ?
finally , i turn to the role of the european union .
it was a question of upwards harmonisation .
even the common position proposal of 7 years is too long .
mr president , i would like to thank mr adam for his excellent report .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
– mr president , i keep on hearing today that we are supposed to be approving a compromise .
we in this committee have achieved something .
i wished to take a stand against the ever - persistent use of nuclear power .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
every day , 500 women die from the complications that arise as a result of illegal and risky abortions .
i ask you : what are they up to ?
i believe that this is possible .
the natural environment in large parts of the north of the eu has little capacity to act as a buffer against pollution .
the question now is what can we still do to guarantee a better outcome ?
the europe we need is community - oriented rather than intergovernmental .
the vote was contested , but common sense prevailed .
europe should therefore remain unyielding and continue to speak with one voice .
the second essential requirement is that legally binding targets be set .
the danish social democrats have voted against an extension of europol 's powers .
we fully agree with the basic analysis of the european parliament and the member states .
15 . structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco (
finally , i have two comments in response to mr lipietz .
in the absence of a green euro , will there be a compensation coefficient ?
i hope it still thinks so .

if a corridor is not quickly created , an unparalleled humanitarian disaster threatens .
. this directive is an important legislative text on the environment .
( pl ) mr president , defence of human rights is the trademark of the european union .
the european companies register has a special importance in guaranteeing the control of good repute .
mr president , i too , want to be brief .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
there is an imbalance here .
the british conservatives are a recipe for disaster for britain and for europe .
it depends on having more of a europe and certainly not less of a europe .
we need progress here .
this is not a new tactic , but it is no less furtive or reprehensible for that .
the same problem applies to the standardisation of values for coastal waters and fresh waters .
and now we get proposals to regulate it , even from liberals !
this is not the end of the procedure .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
efficient administration can not allow this inequality .
implementing the mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function .
for a year the price of fuel has been stifling our fishermen economically .
i would say that this is actually quite an advantage .
so the advantage for the consumer is highly likely to be illusory .
should this situation arise , what line should we take ?
i should like to comment on a few of the issues raised here tonight .
in that respect , she has achieved more than her predecessor .
these people , however , are precisely the people who are usually trying to deny us our authority .
in our capacity as citizens , we have freedoms and rights , but we also have responsibilities .
that is why we have this campaign of vilification .
we must not think along medium - term and short - term lines .
in polish , we say we have reached the wall .
to put it in a nutshell , the information system must be placed in a broader framework .
that is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted .
secondly , this is not a new subject .
this map - making process is therefore particularly important .
that is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .
mr president , i will start by saying something about money .
each of these institutions has its own specific competitiveness .
finding the right channels to do that is not very easy .
we should not just give them money and paper but give them real capacities .
madam president , i should like to extend a warm thanks to the rapporteur for the work she has done .
i trust that it will be possible to reach agreement before 1 may.
and what are the russians doing to help us in this area ?
( lt ) bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world .
i hope mr byrne , when he comes to reply , will be able to tell us .
you heard a speaker for and a speaker against .
i wish turkey and the eu much wisdom and patience on that day and in the days to come .
as a result , women are more affected than men by persistent poverty .
how would this improve the current situation ?
- ( sv ) as a swedish christian democrat , i have voted against this report .
however , europe can not just settle for a humanitarian response .
what do we offer our businesses and our citizens ?
having said that , i should now like to go over the important points in the report .
i voted against .
let me give you some examples .
i would therefore also like to see the commission do what is necessary to urge the council to make amendments .
public funding is not the only funding .
the union has an important part to play in supporting the peace process in the middle east .
in the end , this is what the principle of ' ownership ' means .
the proposal further focuses on the burden of proof .
safety of toys ( debate )
also , mr lyon alone referred to the historical basis .
the questions that arise are therefore the following :
europe needs morocco and vice - versa .
( the sitting was closed at 12.05 am . )
that concludes voting time .
harrison report ( a4 - 0161/96 )
i think we need to look for a far more pragmatic solution .
i am referring to peace , stability , the elimination of poverty and development of the country .
when it does , i believe we will once again have the opportunity to insist on this debate .
the private sector will be more involved .
the answer to difference is to respect it .
as mrs green has just declared , this was no confusion .
i am committed to that .
i shall now put the request from the group of the party of european socialists to a vote .
this concerned how to overcome the democratic deficit . the supranational proposals of the convention would simply increase it still further .
the vote will take place on wednesday 11 july 2007 .
it is doing this is a systematic manner .
amendments 5 and 9 can not , therefore , be approved .
we all agree that tax evasion should be stopped .
you mentioned the objective of a competitive , knowledge - based economy and we go along with that .
in 1996 , 20.18 % of the population were over 58 .
on the virgin report ( a4 - 0241/97 )
there are equivalence problems , and these will not go away .
mr president , nuclear energy commands our constant attention .
these consequences are even more dramatic in the case of countries governed by dictators .
it is therefore obvious that power can not be completely unaccountable .
debt relief is one of the millennium objectives for development .
it must provide practical advantages in exchange for our requiring reforms .
it would be possible to be a bit more flexible in this respect , and it would keep the members happy too .
however , we should not forget that we compete on a solid basis of friendship .
even outside europe , i believe , we have to keep a watchful eye on this .
our stance is that parliament must not put obstacles in the way of enlargement .
this is also something that has been said , and it is not in line with the interpretation of articles 14 and 15 .
what is your vision of the world and of the european union 's place in it ?
asking questions like this is allowed .
since we both are accomplished cyclists , this will undoubtedly be appreciated by parliament .
there were two main areas where the court of auditors identified problems .
the instrument is in two main parts - geographic and thematic .

simplifying the lives of europeans is one of the eu 's concerns .
if i say two female politicians , however , then i must also say that these are two women who have been elected .
we send teams of experts , often legal experts , and we use the impel system in order to encourage and facilitate the transposition of the environmental legislation in general and the waste legislation in particular .
( the president cut off the speaker )
the greenland agreement is different .
unfortunately , we can not operate in this way in the council .
we talk about liberalization . parliament contributes substantially to this process .
there are two positive points that i would like to mention .
as i have said , we should go further .
that is a win - win situation in legislation .
what fascism has to do with climate change is a complete mystery to me .
a success in luxembourg would also be a contribution to making enlargement acceptable .
president - in - office of the council . - firstly , my response to mr pirker .
in my opinion , the opposite would be the case .
in europe , our primary mode of transport is the car .
there are in any budget process successes and failures .
i advise this house to think very carefully and to refer it to the court .
is this russia worthy of being a strategic partner of the eu ?
i call on the council and on all the member states to make the regime ’s pariah status effective at last .
madam president , i did not fully understand what mrs müller said .
this is a particular concern of mine personally and also of the council ’s as a whole .

the vote will take place during the next part - session in december .
we are ready to engage constructively , and iran knows that .
it has already been mentioned .
the vaccination administered is effective for only six to nine months .
why have these murders happened ?
this study would indicate whether eu harmonisation is really required .
that has nothing to do with rights .
these disturbances lead to large - scale migration .
they do not actually know what it means .
indeed , the northern ireland assembly has been suspended .
after all , the number of errors in relation to the structural funds has been too high for many years now .
for this reason , the commission can accept this amendment .
the level of ambition must be higher , however .
however , how the substance got into the products is not clear .
this would please us enormously .
mr féret and i have sharply different political opinions .
madam president , i think this is the right moment to make a remark .
let us have those options available to people .
am i serious ?
i have a key witness here .
but it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do .
if member states ' forecasts are to be believed , that will be necessary .
you must be joking ! '
we take note of your remarks on the minutes .
we must ask ourselves whether this is the kind of eu that we want .
there have only been nine rejections .
taking account of these comments our group will be supporting this report .
here is my boarding pass - but air france would not let me on the aeroplane .
so what can we change about the system ?
species of animal are also missing from the commission 's proposal .

but , when the matter came to light , it was put right immediately .
they are to be protected in the event of the insolvency of their insurance company .
the following questions are thus raised , with regard to the service : what is its organic configuration ?
this can be a matter of life and death for these people .
it is astonishing , however , that cars contribute only 1 % of the total quantity of waste in the eu .
the same argument applies to the french nuclear deterrent .
there is a lack of an underlying plan .
i think they should have been taken by now .

i could hear in his presentation and in his voice his commitment to europe .
we have made ourselves part of the negotiations in the council .
in two and a half years the legislation will come into force .
the new administration in the us has given a new stimulus to these relations .
this means in practice that the budget for the common foreign policy will be reduced in real terms .
it would also have a direct effect on a significant number of jobs being kept .
i maintain all that i said about education in palestine .
we must not let this opportunity slip through our fingers .
how do we control the flows of immigration which arise ?
it is not clear yet what the specific results will be following this visit .
it would be more sensible to buy these animals in order to destroy the meat .
only a few hands were somewhat hesitantly raised .

( the president cut off the speaker )
this budget is under discussion .
there is no point arguing about that : savings will be made .
football is a passion that unites all the countries .
it was for parliament to decide that .
those that have fewer entrepreneurs and fewer patents just go backwards .
we think that a sensible compromise has been found here .
they are mostly coming into the union as refugees .
external border controls are also vital .
3 . we must not go down the road of making excessive demands of each other .
europe is the cradle of the cinema .
excessive deficits and economic policies
according to mrs berger , the structure of the document was somewhat chaotic .
but let me warn them : it is a long way from theory to practice .
we need them especially because of the crisis through which we are passing .
the debate is closed .
i believe that the stability and definition of the legal basis are of great importance for parliament and its members .
this would benefit the european union and our efforts to achieve the objectives in terms of the lisbon agenda .
recently in the czech republic there was restructuring in the banking sector .
i think that the work we have done collectively is sound .
in my view that is very low .
in closing , i would like to make two key points .
waddington ( a4 - 0373/98 ) , pack ( a4 - 0371/98 ) and de coene ( a4 - 0389/98 ) reports
we must , though , weigh up their merits .
another complaint is that too many turkish settlers will remain on the island .
i believe it should be dealt with instead as an idea that is still at the general stage .
the timeframe should , in my view , be limited to sundays .
i myself am the daughter of resistance fighters .
we are not here to decide whether these people are guilty or innocent .
– the debate is closed .
the single market is prey to tensions and repercussions .
you are quite right .
that is why i believe that this report should be referred back to committee .
the successes and achievements of the past speak for themselves .
i received 3 830 complaints in 2006 .
please would you pass this message on to them once again .
as for the second question , if i may continue .
as the only explanation , the commission continues to rely on the vague concept of lack of confidence .
the situation in côte d'ivoire is primarily about the blame game .
however , it is important that ukraine implements systematic economic reforms .
fortunately , over the past few years , this attitude has started to change .
as regards the budget , i know that additional funds could turn out to be necessary .
the institutions must therefore give some serious thought to this issue .
we are here to obtain results for the citizens of the balkans .
we have expressed our views on this before .
the ombudsman himself touched upon this .
it was very important to find a way to resolve this problem together .
i feel that we should address this quite openly .
if amendments 17 and 18 are not adopted , i will be voting against the end result .
in writing . - we have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that :
i will support that call , as will the majority of my group .
i hope that we can bring about change in line with what parliament wants .
echo ' s representative is now in the panshir valley in order to assess the situation .
if you would rather , we can try to organise things in this way . at the moment we are waiting for the report to be available in all languages .
the legislative framework must follow this .
basically , it supports the commission ’s position .
i really hope this is the case .
the second example is the dismissal of a certain commission staff member .
we agreed that the union needs a clear strategy on intellectual property rights .
we are going to vote on this agreement at 12.00 .
certainly not all countries will be able to start at the same time .
the increase in the employment rate is closely linked to the eu 's industrial policy .
the commission communication is therefore most welcome , albeit over - long .
inspections in third countries are important .
the proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory bodies of the council .
so far the commission has stood very firm in this dispute .
i believe that it is the responsibility of the institutionsto promote this idea .
we therefore wholeheartedly support mr buşoi 's report .
in this context , i wish you every success in your task .
they will resist and they will not allow the implementation of this policy .
the reason for this is clearly the cost of access to these new services .
let us be responsible , first and foremost , for ourselves .
you may well ask what my intention was in doing so .
the british people do not want it .
i have heard commissioner verheugen use the term ‘ zero tolerance’ , and i find it an appealing one .
we know today that safety rules vary greatly from one eu country to another .
obstacles do exist and we must do our best to overcome them .
she is to be congratulated on this .
the member states , as well as the commission , have clear responsibilities in this area .
the reform treaty provides for the enlargement of the audit committee .
i would really advise against adopting these amendments in the strongest terms .
members from my group are concerned .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
there are murmurs from france .
i like that : i have always argued that they should have .
in dealing with the matters which have given rise to concern in the house , i shall endeavour to do so from the council ' s point of view .
this concerns the right regulatory environment ; colleagues will have copies of the text .
we came out as soon as the bell rang for a vote .
i am sure that will also be borne in mind .
i think it had two effects .
the situation is especially grave with roma women in central - eastern europe .
sadly , no consensus was reached in rio regarding forests .
needless to say , the new convention can not provide answers to all those questions .
i should point out that we are going to vote first on the amendments .
the fact is , rosé wine is produced from the fermentation of predominantly red grapes or must .
the eu is one of the global leaders in the field of research and innovation , including in the agricultural sector .
circulation of compound feedingstuffs
in the report , hopes are expressed concerning the newly - created un human rights council .
evidence , indeed , of the law of unintended consequences .
thirdly , we must defend the principle of a hierarchy of norms .
it is clear that we are working with two basic presuppositions .
i therefore voted against the report .
any further malicious and unfounded political attacks will be redundant .
let us make sure that this cooperation continues in the future .
we have got electronic tagging .
we have also received some very good ideas including journalist awards .
i agree with the rapporteur on this issue .
burgenland has been granted objective 1 status and is to receive a total of 160 m ecu from 1995 to 1999 .
it is much harder to give a short speech .
who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
they are being damaged for life .
this explains the list for our negotiations at the end of june .
so help us do this - propose something really tangible !
only those who realise their mistakes can remedy them .
( parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
the developing countries are now suffering a triple blow .
the commission submitted a proposal for a directive in 2000 .
and what are the circumstances ?
learning methods should be more flexible and accessible on a lifelong basis .
mr president , when the situation heats up , we have to keep cool heads .
sustainability must be ensured .
mr president , commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .
that is unacceptable .
it has brought about increases in disease and crime .
this aspect is vital for ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
the metten report says it should .
i would ask you to make this parliament 's position in respect of these remarks quite clear .
for this reason , a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force .
we also understand , as i said , that this is an issue of human rights and protection of human rights .
but surely that is what we all ultimately wish to see !
the commission must adopt the proposals put forward by parliament .
let us not , however , treat them like a universal panacea .
we would do better to put this into the explanations and notes . we accept amendments nos 6 and 10 , but oppose nos 1 , 8 , 9 and 23 .
even if there are reservations , that point is extremely important .
in that case , we could vote in favour , if not we will vote against .
mr president , on a point of order .
let us revere and honour them .
what did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations ?
that is why we say ' yes ' to the internal market .
it is very good .
this project receives a european union contribution of eur   12.5 million .
that is my only satisfaction as an mep and as a european citizen .
mr president , it can not have been approved unanimously .
that is all i have to say .
there is no room for these in the regulation .
it should be added that community fleets are among the largest exploiters of these stocks .
she has not allowed herself to be diverted by all the noise around her .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 june 2003 .
certain things have also gone wrong over the years .
this importance is particular evident in the area of employment .
the very notion of mainstreaming remains rather obscure for many .
this is what is meant by european defence and security .
many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of member states .
this is what we achieved in the european parliament at first reading .
no man kills women and children and lives to boast of it .
we have to provide space for new initiatives .
the vague use of the term ' radicalisation ' as an indicator for ' non - democratic actions ' ;
a diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock .
democracy is vital .
this is the limited number of exits from , and entrances into , this chamber .
we will need to be involved in these operations , partly on humanitarian grounds .
we shall then have a sound solution .
we must therefore combat these smugglers first of all .
i want to address a number of points in mr gasòliba 's excellent report .
the christian democrat party has been mentioned .
what action should be taken ?
for this reason , i move that the title be amended accordingly .
( de ) madam president , i would ask that this amendment should be supported .
i should also like to emphasize the need to take political factors into account .
however , we have to remember that market economies do not have any intrinsic value in themselves .
but we all know that we need a base line of government involvement .
we will be glad to support you on this .
subject : anti - lisbon rhetoric
we have to deal with the figures .
i think that we all know the rules by now .
does anyone wish to speak against ?
in writing . - ( lv ) i fully supported this proposal for a resolution .
i deeply regret the losses suffered by the scottish salmon industry .
personally i am disappointed with the commissioner 's position on this issue .
the public authorities have a supervisory role .
first of all , the budget is near enough double the size of the original amount .
we would like to think a little further about the actual wording there .
that is what europe needs , not a european automobile industry policy .
( fr ) the report we are examining today tries to be modern and libertarian .
we should not and can not wait that long .
perhaps the president of the commission can say something about this .
mr president , i would just like to make a correction of a linguistic nature .
for a long time we have been debating flexicurity .
but hysteria makes for a poor counsellor .
it seems to me a real possibility that it will depart from it .
oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see minutes
question time ( commission )
mr president , i shall be very brief and make just three comments .
so there are other successful , ethical and non - controversial alternatives .
nevertheless , many people are freezing in their own homes .
he has paid the ultimate price for his bravery .
madam president , i am grateful to my friend mr mann for demonstrating that we are back in step once again .
unfortunately , on many other points my report is very current , and by no means outdated .
this means that globalisation can also be at the service of people , and not the other way round .
in this i am convinced that the eu must take the initiative .
not everything has been acquired yet , but we are on the road to consultation .
( parliament approved the minutes . )
the best way of combating this is investing the eu structural funds in young professionals .
medicine is to be given the socialist treatment .
this is decided in the basic act .
agenda for next sitting : see minutes
i have therefore voted in favour of the text .
we must have regulations .
this was a first . there had not been a meeting of this type since 1981 .
cogeneration is now on the european union ’s energy policy agenda .
i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate mr blokland on his report .
mr president , i would like to ask a question please .
i have two further points to make on this process .
thank you , sir leon .
it is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
i can assure you that the services will look into this very closely , mr poettering .
even worse , this is happening inside our european union .
so i will put it to parliament .
this figure should , however , be used with caution .
thank you for asking this question .
the next item is the statements from the council and the commission on the members ' statute .
this is not about member states , this is about fundamental rights .
the eu can only spend a maximum of 1.2 % of the combined gdp of all its member states .
a win - win situation .
i look back with pleasure on her tenacity during the trialogues .
the sector offers a huge range of opportunities , development potential and jobs .
we are using a style of communication that is comprehensible to the population .
yes , provided we have the resources needed .
( ga ) mr president , i have a few points to make on this topic .
real grievances must be faced - and left behind .
the european union has been concerned with colombia for a long time .
the vertical level is also very important .
thank you most sincerely .
these include honourable organisations like the deutsche welthungerhilfe .
that gas comes from russia .
the commission proposal has been improved considerably .
we made recommendations in that regard .
if you do not take yourself seriously , then others will not take you seriously either .
i can keep this relatively brief .
i think you are proposing to do that on 31 proposals in 2004 .
environmental protection promotes competitiveness .
this proposal is also currently before the council and parliament .
to give a practical example , gazprom is buying up the larger energy companies in europe .
it simplifies legal procedures and instruments .
that is our important social - democratic goal .
this legislation is just a band - aid in terms of the necessity out there .
let us think of the cuts in social policy , internal policies , energy policy , and the rest .
personally , i think the answer is clear .
as you have gone this far , why not the taliban , hezbollah or the tamil tigers ?
this was approved here during the last legislature .
associated companies
at present , the us has not made a formal request .
secondly , i would like to focus on the amendments tabled in the european parliament .
it is for those reasons that the socialist group will support amendment no 11 .
council positions at first reading : see minutes
commissioner , it is an excellent decision .
to settle as a border dispute the status of the aegean , where greece does not acknowledge that there is an issue ?
however , it is a fact that people still complain about over - booking .
this is what the treaty ultimately proposes
but , wait a bit , there are some facts and figures to go with the jargon .
the celebrations in berlin were a very inspiring moment for europe .
thirdly , visa waiver between the eu and russia is the right goal .
an inclusive dialogue is required , leading to a political settlement .
9 . deontological questions related to companies ' management (
we have one - the commission !
consultation with the liberals leads me to ask that ‘ uk legislation’ be changed to ‘ uk and/or eu legislation’ .
the debate is closed .
the issue is one of the european union 's priorities , and we must welcome that fact .
that is why i voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the forest fires in the summer of 2009 .
president - in - office of the council , please tell your colleagues to take a long - term view .
this year the commission has taken several initiatives in the fight against fraud .
and we have no intention of introducing any .
rapporteur , i owe you an apology .
to move on to the next point , which is the economic situation and prospects for the european union .
the ' novel foods ' regulation is based on this dubious compromise text .
this directive has been improved considerably since the first reading .
and i wish here to underline the words of mrs pack .
understand that one if you can !
what have we done previously ?
there are two points that i would like the commissioner to shed some light on for me .
that is not the problem , however .
( de ) mr president , money simply is a part of the development of europe .
and so you will have this communication , which will enable a real evaluation to be made of the practical measures that are adopted .
what has been put in place in the so - called reform does not even do that .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 137(1 ) of the rules of procedure )
that is heavy and demanding work .
the next item is the joint debate on :
once again , congratulations to mr herman , and our best wishes go with you .
i would be one of the first to welcome a very thorough inquiry .
( the sitting was suspended at 9.35 a.m. and resumed at 9.45 a.m. )
in a way , that much is recognised in the current proposals .
the council would call attention to the fact that the northern stock is a biological concept .
the realisation of the process requires initiatives .
the system took no account of the fact that resources were limited .
let us therefore make the most of these positive elements .
we have therefore voted against this joint resolution .
that is one question .
now that more than a decade has passed , the balance sheet is clearly positive .
we agreed to continue the talks in the near future .
the european parliament has debated the issue of turkey a good deal .
i believe we need an independent inquiry into these incidents .
above all , there needs to be greater monitoring of the implementation of bilateral agreements .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
however , the ecosystem of the high north is relatively self - sustaining and therefore extremely sensitive .
how are we to increase total research funding to three per cent of gdp ?
president - in - office of the council . - yes , we have indeed discussed this in the council several times .
finally , i believe that it is essential to also consider having transitional periods .
that does not mean that i am completely happy with what we have before us .
that , too , is what those who elected you expect .
we see a situation where the most prosperous of the member states are saying ' not a penny more ' .
that really is good news , even though few people know about it .
hundreds of thousands of animals now travel with their owners each year across europe .
we all know how dicey it becomes when we are exhausted doing something as simple as working on our computers .
would german soldiers be able to assist finland in guarding its external border with russia ?
this will be checked and , if it is the case , your remark will be taken into account and the necessary rectification carried out .
this will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector .
first , prevention , of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of kosovo .
the forthcoming npt review is an opportunity that must not be wasted .
individual research activities are useful , but not necessarily useful enough .
for that purpose we have to provide adequate financial support .
protection of public figures is the responsibility of the hosting state .
se we can not deny that the picture is mixed .
that is an interesting question .
thank you , mr cunha .
that is what the amendments by the legal affairs committee amount to .
i imagine you are referring to rule 145 .
what steps will the council take to assist mr housel ?
that has cost the council money .
we have both the will and the means to be able to solve this problem gradually .
that really would be demanding the impossible .
we do not know exactly what the situation is at present .
tolerance , dialogue , mutual respect and understanding are , for some , parts of their faith .
unfortunately , they were unable to do so .
for a very long time on both sides cooperation remained the priority of a few .
it must be made very clear that the health card is a voluntary matter .
the vote will take place next thursday .
that warning will be noted .
we might add , however , that the survey should have gone a lot further .
we are told that it is best left to the member states to deal with these matters .
on the contrary , the technical committee wants to draw your attention to the need to look at the issue as a whole .
i do not need a council representative here in order to tell them that i think they are undemocratic .
we should not forget that .
yet that does not mean that there is nothing to do in the interim .
things need to be done with the cooperation of people , not for them .
mr schmidt , mr trichet , i absolutely can not go along with these proposals .
institutions alone , however , are not enough .
the union now consists of a great number of member states .
the report also contains other areas that need attention .
in every country in europe , unemployment has grown by leaps and bounds .
the main points of the compromise can be summarised as follows .
but what is the european union ?
here i am thinking in particular of the tep and the preparations for the millennium round .
they thereby make it clear that they have not learnt anything at all from history .
that would be a very good example of a fast - track procedure .
i do not regard that as a good development .
this must strengthen the eu as a whole , while also taking regional differences into account .
we do not have any such officers , but black grandmothers are in fact to be found .
the proposal has two aspects to it which ought to be emphasised .
what 's going on , mr president ?
i certainly support what the chairman of my group has said .
the vote will take place on tuesday .
we are at a turning point .
the only thing that worries me is this false sense of security .
we have always had this support from the commission .
( fr ) madam president , i would like to thank our rapporteur .
i shall turn to them briefly now .
and , i hope , albanian as well .
the agreement also provides for a scientific observer to be on board .
i hope that a large majority will endorse the napolitano report .
we have more victims in forced labour .
if truth be told , the european parliament has never negotiated anything in the way of progress .
mrs neyts - uyttebroeck is no longer an mep .
it does not make humanitarian sense .
the prize giving ceremony will be on wednesday , 16 december in strasbourg .
however , we should now proceed with our programme and not be distracted too much .
all i am asking is , will the commission prepare an analysis ?
we have no reservations whatsoever in this regard .
the situation requires our response .
that is our main task .
the impetus for this democracy movement came from prague and gdansk .
i am pointing this out now because it is , of course , right to learn from experiences such as this .
the procedure in a horizontal committee was new .
they themselves are hardly a role model for europe .
that is why i voted in favour of this resolution .
what the georgian state authority did is a crime against the people of ossetia and abkhazia .
there is an international convention called the stcw on minimum levels of training for seafarers .
if we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a europe that will be much poorer .
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
not so much with words as with deeds .
many people with disabilities face discrimination , maltreatment and institutional confinement .
the first is that we are forgetting what the discharge procedure consists of .
many thanks , president - in - office , for your report and for your work .
what has happened to small dealers in recent years ?
many people are asking why this should be .
let me reiterate the importance of the principle of concentration .
any electoral improvement is welcome .
there is a lot of money at stake here , the way this field has developed .
what is the situation , for example , with our laws on intellectual property and patents ?
all this is necessary and needs to be worked out energetically and with a view to the long term .
but we would like to concentrate primarily on three main points .
would you believe it ?
that notwithstanding , visa costs should be reduced .
so the cohesion fund is an essential instrument .
i do not think it will come to that .
neither should this , to my mind , spell the painful end of muskrats .
let this prediction by scientists serve as an important warning .
this will be vital for achieving a lasting peace in the region .
i voted in favour .
in conclusion , i should like to address some more general issues related to the economy .
we need simple rules on the transferability of occupational pensions .
the position has improved most of all for young officials .
it would be different if we were always talking about projects of national interest .
i think it is a good definition and rule and would add to the debate .
so many migrants die trying to get to europe .
retailers do not even label which animal the furs originate from .
does the commission plan to implement other internal measures to resolve the belarus problem ?
we are talking about a country which has just been elected into the human rights council of the united nations .
however , this is not a conflict where the two sides are equal .
within which frameworks are we to act ?
the debate is closed .
we want to help them .
this is a problem for us , as there is little we can do .
it is indeed a marvellous little big land , this grand duchy of luxembourg !
how can i explain why ?
questions to mr byrne
enlargement is the second predominant issue .
we must find a way to stop that .
president barroso talked about prizes .
i am confident that this can be achieved .
a positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me .
but we shall have to produce a model at european level .
from the budget of member states ?
that would save time .
the debate is closed .
it had become a pick - and - mix with something for everyone .
that is not foreseeable at the moment , though .
i can assure you that we are checking this .
liberalisation of trade requires liberalisation of human rights in china .
mr sjöstedt is well aware of my opinion on this subject .
i would therefore ask you , mr prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .
thirdly and finally , i wish to warn my colleagues in the ppe group .
we should definitely conduct that debate together .
when will we debate that ?
there are some very important issues relating to best practices .
this announcement will be made in brussels .
likewise where the environment is concerned , not enough precautionary measures have been taken .
this is a serious misunderstanding .
we must all respect the irish vote .
i shall deal first with the question of council approval .
the new problem that appears to be emerging now is the situation of the east timorese in west timor .
mr president , i thank the president - in - office of the council for his reply .
the increase in spending on research and innovation is justified .
mr leinen discussed this , as did mr baltas and , just now , mrs van lancker .
mr chichester and mr van velzen quite rightly pointed that out in their reports .
it remains to be seen whether this will prove possible in our presidency .
now it is a question of what the role of the european union is .
i would like to make a little joke here .
moreover , the financing has still not been clarified .
common european funds for new technologies means , firstly , partnership .
it is very sustainable , but it is entirely impractical for the job i do .
i shall now put the request to a vote .
there are nonetheless a few points that will have to be voted on separately .
if we do not recognise that now then i do not know when we will .
what happened here demonstrates the value added by the european union and the european parliament .
the vote will take place during the first part - session in may.
we need to think about this very carefully : visas are necessary , and how !
among democrats , such a thing should be self - evident .
it is therefore essential that we agree on this compromise text .
- ( sv ) we believe that the focus of alcohol policy should be decided at national level .
one only has to look to the past .
mr chairman , ladies and gentlemen , you are what you eat .
question no 14 by alex smith ( h-0903/97 )
we really need more from the commission when we get incidents like this .
i now come to the statement of assurance .
it should not have .
that is something of which politicians in all our member states are aware .
this is the only way for us to curb the impact of climate change in future .
however , this only applies to about 9 % of all structural fund resources .
on the other hand , i am indeed able to list the achievements of the last four years .
this is in an effort to respond to the islamic courts .
we should be expanding e - commerce .
i hope we can continue along this road which i feel is the right one .
we must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established .
i also assume that most macedonians want it .
therefore , i oppose this proposal .
langen report ( a4 - 0084/98 )
a few more will be completed during the portuguese presidency .
thank you very much , mr santer .
we are not going to re - open the debate .
industry must therefore also to a large extent be involved .
( the sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m. )
this means that she can not understand why this young woman is involved in the otpor organisation .
this should therefore be addressed first .
mr president , that does not leave us much time to table amendments .
instead , what has been done ?
these problems are complex .
at the appropriate time , the commission put forward a proposal , which we believed to be reasonable .
to date , this conflict has resulted in 400 000 deaths and has displaced 2 million people .
i shall return to all these points in order , if i may .
the very existence of maize is an example of this .
mr president , i should like to make one final point .
for us , too , the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue .
in future years , real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees .
amendment no 1 because it is not clear what is meant by a transitional period .
intrastat was created .
he should be quite clear about that procedure within our group .
i want to pose a question to the president .
this reform is essential .
mr napolitano spoke of establishing a supranational entity .
we have taken the position that spent nuclear fuel must be controlled .
unfortunately , it is still the case that many young people take up smoking .
thank you very much , mr swoboda .
( de ) mr president , mr barroso , mr reinfeldt , your calm and steady presidency was a success .
( the commissioner declined to do so . )
we are all agreed on that , but it just is not happening .
so why are we rejecting this directive ?
firstly , let me hark back to the wording of our question .
it would be much clearer simply to ban drinking .
the committee on women ’s rights is unwilling to tolerate this silence any longer .
however , parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the garriga polledo report .
congratulations !
i would just like to make one last point about the african union .
i say this to everyone .
that is the responsible method that we have to follow .
finally , the presidency has identified environmental policy as one of its priorities .
commissioner lamy has the floor .
however , that should not in any case exonerate us from strategic thinking in two areas .
madam president , i rise to make just one point , but an important one .
of course there will be problems on specific points .
we will be equally active , but without concessions .
what will the international community do ?
i therefore particularly welcome the courageous political work done by our rapporteur , mrs haug .
the debate is closed .
life for pensioners in my country is not the easiest .
in any case , you have said that there is no time to waste .
it promised to do so in informal talks with members of this parliament last november .
that would have been a catastrophe of the sort that one would rather not talk about .
with the threat of difficulties created by the winter , the situation is really becoming acute .
the commission is also stating that the numbers are not yet large enough .
do we suddenly have to add this to the tasks of the european union ?
let us make comparisons which make sense .
fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are still not respected .
when changing provider , consumers must be able to keep their own number within a day .
do not make me laugh !
i tend to agree more with mr pronk than with the commission .
there is a high level of illiteracy in our partner countries .
they will speak in more detail now .
in this way , far better use could , in fact , be made of the internal market .
what the people talked about was coordinated violence against them .
this is only information about when nothing has been done .
i would like to thank all my fellow members for their willingness to compromise on this matter .
( de ) mr president , i should like to express just one single thought , indeed more of a request .
article k.9 of the treaty on european union
you have correctly pointed out that you can receive two telephone calls .
thank you , commissioner .
the christian minority are not allowed to build churches or to teach their religion in schools .
it is not normally possible to work under such conditions .
may i also stress that it is essential to avoid any exceptions .
to sum up , i would like to return briefly to the issue of intelligence gathering .
but a poor competitive position means the loss of jobs .
thank god we are there .
please , show a little solidarity with the commission .
mrs kokkola , kosovo is in fact included on the agenda .
the eu has not put all of the regulations from 2004 into practice .
the report is more than worthy of support .
a new approach has been initiated , creating a europe of knowledge .
the answer is , unfortunately , no .
that is not its objective and , moreover , this is stated in protocol 8 of the treaty of lisbon .
we should look after this partnership .
mr president , we are always so surprised when the balance of nature is upset .
this is a position we can not justify to our taxpayers .
today , the eu requires good government on the part of third countries before development aid can be granted .
written statements ( rule 149 )
if we can put this right , this will constitute a huge step forward .
it actually takes twice as long for these chickens to reach slaughter weight .
i can remember back to the beginning of the liberalization debate .
since there are no further comments , the minutes are approved .
it should not be inconceivable .
commissioner , you have also emphasised that we need to have the same standards in all member states .
mr désir was right about agricultural liberalisation .
the rapporteur has explained it .
association of overseas countries and territories with the ec
this is an unambiguous verdict .
that remains the inspiration and the intention behind the meeting that will take place tomorrow .
the participation of women in gainful employment is still very low .
the ferry connection is quite crucial in this connection .
the only reason that this has not been more widely condemned is precisely because it affects romani women .
that is why it is important for us to vote today .
fifth , we want to accommodate regional diversity .
a second question on this subject , commissioner , concerns the following .
they have become outdated and no longer reflect the realities of the financial services sector .
two thirds of our workers work for these enterprises and they generate 50 % of gross domestic product .
finally , i would like to come to the matter that lies close to our hearts : social competence .
this performance level must be defined .
however , half way through the meeting , mr president , mr mauro used an example .
we already have an excellent european education system , and we do not need to reproduce it .
we are also pleased that the union has allocated funds for humanitarian support .
waste crisis in campania ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see minutes
but we buried a heroic man , and not the courage he inspired in others ' .
is it 10 , 20 or 30 % profit and do our citizens have to pay that ?
if we can not , then what i want to know is why we bother about the shape of cucumbers .
regarding funding , there is no fund or mechanism for the time being .
the existence of thousands of farmers is currently under threat .
in this connection , i welcome the arrival of mr   juncker , known as mr   euro .
i am sure that mr lange will be delighted to know that he looks like clark gable .
that is surely a splendid compromise .
we try to shorten this period as much as possible .
the elderly are not a homogeneous group .
first we must finalise the igc and sign the reform treaty .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , 500 days from now euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation .
the elimination of transaction costs and the lowering of interest rates is good news .
are we to expect quotas to be discontinued at that time ?
i asked you to tell me what your current thinking is in the commission .
therefore i ask you to support amendments 107 , 108 and 109 .
the situation is getting no better .
proposal for a joint resolution on human rights
however , this is not necessarily the case in the new member states .
i think that its preventative work will increase .
mr president , i rise in support of the costa report .
commissioner , we call for the list of raw materials to be updated regularly .
they all have the potential to create jobs and growth .
on amendment no 21
however , the rules governing auxiliary agents should be identical for all medicinal products .
a comparative study has also been carried out examining asylum application procedures in switzerland and germany .
some do one thing , others do another .
there is no need for a directive .
the regional aid map for state aid rules in europe is in serious need of redrawing .
it has been applied in varying degrees since the 1970s .
the debate is closed .
vote ‘ yes’ , and throw it out !
without the support of the chinese , the junta would not survive .
unfortunately , i could not therefore support this proposal to reject the budget .
should more be done in the field of agriculture ?
who knows the risks of enlargement ?
the eu must therefore be an area of solidarity .
insufficient resources have been allocated to that important task .
this situation , though , is rather different .
the answer is not necessarily as clear and straightforward as we might instinctively imagine .
i understand that this will be a formal motion .
there is no point in complaining about this .
this redistribution of financial power is also shaping our political discussions .
martens report ( a4 - 0274/97 )
we really do need to proceed with environmental economic accounts .
mr president , i see that this afternoon we are to debate the european footwear sector .
you can not lead people towards their destiny blindfold .
that is our responsibility , therefore , and we must put our hearts and souls into it .
a modern , european serbia has a major responsibility here .
that is not the way things are as mr   lisi said too .
the key concept is the concept of trust .
otherwise the lisbon strategy is worthless .
this is somewhere else where we must help .
your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened .
why do we do so little ?
that is the simple outcome of the agenda , my dear president - in - office of the council !
this right is indispensable if the directive is to have meaning .
can we wind up the committee on women 's rights ?
these countries need to speed up their reforms and actively pursue them .
that was subject to evaluation and an assessment in the circumstances that now prevail .
they also teach the monks that the dalai lama is a danger .
it is the history of the firm determination that grew out of the ruins , the history of a ‘ never again!’
a case of double standards that requires an explanation .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
subject : legal rights of asylum - seekers
today the more successful of the two stands before you .
in the end , i voted against the proposal , for the following reasons .
there is nothing more human and , at the same time , european .
i would be interested to hear the commission ’s opinion on this matter .
they come to take profits and , it would appear , the unstable situation is to their advantage .
commissioner michel visited the region himself at the end of april .
we are still the largest market for energy in terms of consumption , ahead of china and the united states .
however , there are other things i do not understand .
the spirit of the report is objective and critical , yet constructive .
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
to this end , we welcome the commission 's proposal to strengthen circular migration .
we will see what happens then .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1 )
this does not reflect the spirit of the treaty .
there should be some visible eu presence .
yes , that is what i intended to do , mr dell'alba .
some are researching into new fourth - generation reactors , whilst others are not .
the sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m.
first of all : governance .
25 . discharge 2005 : european network and information security agency ( vote )
it would appear that the answer is no .
i wish you the best of luck in ghent .
the union for europe of the nations group supports the directive .
what will it have to say about the fate of the iraqi people , ?
mr bonde , i have cut you off because this is not the time to make statements .
yet the commission and the 15 original member states want to prevent them from doing so .
we must recover our common sense .
it goes without saying that this review will be conducted entirely under the authority of the afghan government .
we are definitely at the forefront when it comes to actual implementation .
he spoke of fairness .
now , with pat cox as our president , we must confront it from day one .
it is very much about jobs .
the aid needs to be more predictable .
both are important , but health is a key issue .
we proposed the recasting of the directive on european work councils .
permit me nonetheless to summarise the background to the lifting of the export ban .
nickel - metal hydrid batteries are a type of battery already used in sweden .
i believe that we are seeing a sort of collective amnesia in our countries .
i am sure that this is not what the majority of our fellow european citizens want .
i certainly will see mr ferber on the specific issue that he raised .
written statements ( rule 149 )
there is no consistent analysis of what we have done so far .
mr president , it was with some regret that i voted for the motion of censure against the commission .
this programme should be settled in the course of 2006 .
in addition , a regrouping and restructuring will be necessary within the commission .
so far this has been forbidden in community waters .
the report we have before us clearly addresses the issue of taxation .
at the same time , we also find that the financial resources this requires are not available .
it is a start , but it is not the end .
austria needs a real solution and that is not what we have here .
it is an issue that can no longer be pushed aside .
the safety of planes and lives must come first .
european council of 23 may 1997
slovakia has made intensive efforts in order to enter the european union .
we have been doing everything we have listed in the communication .
but that does not mean a vote of confidence in the whole college of commissioners .
i tried to avoid going ‘ ’ .
the council 's role is more complicated .
firstly , agriculture is not the problem in the case of climate change , it is the solution .
i do not know whether any particular member state of the european union is responsible for this .
the present draft is our contribution to the pursuit of that aim .
3 . iran : execution of juvenile offenders
the most important are perhaps : what are the benefits ? what are the risks ?
it is artificial , unfair and cut off from the real situation .
we completed the ninth round of negotiations in mid - november in tripoli .
this possibility was removed and i can not understand why .
they are happening on a daily basis .
they call for junk e - mail to be banned .
one final comment - which i know will be a sticking point .
prime minister of ireland .
we were presented with a fait accompli against our will .
no european money should be paid out for company relocations within the european union .
however , this is not an automatic process .
this is the reason why i voted in favour of it .
in europe every year some 8 000 vulnerable road users die , and another 300 000 are injured .
oral explanations of vote
oh , no ! bayer have equalised .
8 . protection of workers against asbestos ( codified version ) (
that does not alter the fact that i agree with both colleagues .
i should therefore like to remind the house , briefly , of the reasons for our insistence .
they should exchange experiences and pass on information about projects to each other .
i am in favour of a system in which independent ex post audits are the rule .
we shall look at it again .
i think this is probably all i need to say by way of introduction .
malta 's position on the agricultural chapter should , i hope , also soon be on the table .
i welcome many of the features .
a lot is being asked of the people and the decision - makers on the path towards agreement .
.eu " top level domain
i am grateful to everyone concerned for their excellent work .
i have a feeling that some things really need to be modified .
procedures without debate :
the european union must show more determination .
i would also like to say a few words on the ratification of the treaty .
for this reason i have abstained from voting on this report .
that is the case also today - but what exactly is the case today ?
may i also say something on the subject of collective redress , with which we have a problem .
this should include an embargo on arms and munitions .
if there is any confusion on that could we at least have some clarification for the future .
what about the european patent , stuck in council ?
the sphere of non - conventional medicine is at present a highly topical and emotive one .
mr elles , you have been wrongly informed .
thank you , commissioner , you are of course quite right .
when will there be a revision of the commission ’s mandate for wto talks ?
this includes my country , poland .
you may not have been aware of this , but that is the case .
that is why we are in favour of tightening up on the use of allergy - causing substances .
we took cognisance of that proposal in the committee on constitutional affairs .
we can not , though , be satisfied with mere promises .
they need to know everyone on board !
in the long run , problems can only be solved at the point where they actually occur .
the same applies to the relex reform .
that will be very welcome .
i support the resolution that we will be voting on tomorrow .
i think that these areas , in addition to education , must be key objectives .
however , any country whose energy supply is based on 90 % coal will find it more difficult to get down to 0 % .
attendance will be better as will decisions .
we have a very strong instrument available to us : the cotonou agreement .
however , i also have two formal comments to make .
where are the governments ?
but i thank the house for its agreement .
they often come from hellish situations and they need to be treated with dignity .
it is simply disgraceful that the system is not yet computerized .
how far has the embargo been successful ?
so i wonder what the point of the decision was .
the european union could provide a best practice model here .
the following amendments have been proposed :
thirdly , there is something new in the new strategy : the national objectives .
composition of parliament : see minutes
paragraph 3 does not reflect properly the intention of those who drafted the text .
i did not feel able to oppose this budget .
we want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate .
we agree with the minimum 0.45 % for the three objectives .
there are just one or two issues i want to raise .
there is still a need for assistance from the european union .
permission was given for it to go through on that basis .
that is not something we are now addressing for the first time .
however , these declarations have not been put into practice .
it has been a genuine pleasure to work with you .
i had to say that .
what about rfid networks ?
i would first like to see proof for such a proposal .
i should like to remind the commissioner that such data will inevitably leak out .
- motion for resolution
well then , there are plenty of opportunities for making serious savings .
amendment no 30 concerns relative stability .
that shows where the bottleneck and the imbalance between the institutions is to be found .
in fact there is not a single mention of it in the resolution .
europe has already looked to us once , when there was war in this region .
frankly , this is a problem in my home country , when it comes to industry .
i would , however , like to draw your attention today to another problem .
the june movement is therefore voting in favour of the proposal .
there is a misprint in our amendment .
that is why i support mr cottigny 's position .
it should be an analysis of the impact of the competition policies , and that is currently lacking .
mr   verheugen also announced a special eu action plan for moldova by may   2004 .
thank you for your brief answer .
we therefore need a proposal from the commission that measures up to the gravity of the situation .
i was keen to point this out .
what happened in 2005 was unfortunate .
in this respect the programme is a step in the right direction .
we have seen how disastrous it was when the united states introduced them .
so let us deal with the real world .
it is not going to be enough simply to refer it to an advisory committee which already exists .
for example , in the environmental field , we have a white paper on civil liability in environmental matters .
madam president , i too want to congratulate the rapporteur .
several programmes have also failed to achieve their objectives .
i am less than delighted that the measures provided for are inadequate .
i would like to focus on just two questions .
the expiry of the cohesion fund at the turn of the millennium is another part of this equation .
could we have a better delivery ?
mr cohn - bendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking .
that applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy .
we really have to do something more than just adopting resolutions .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
as to my tactics , i was not really sure what i should do .
my group is obliged to vote against this report .
all in all , we should be optimistic today .
for these reasons , we are voting against the report and the commission 's proposal .
will environmental and climate change considerations be part of any new wto package ?
so should we .
the european union is asean 's second largest trading partner .
this is an unacceptable situation .
nor should we abandon our development policy .
that can not of course be the commission 's long - term strategy .
we face this challenge with all passenger rights legislation .
that also entails the responsibility to fight fraud and corruption within its activities .
not very revolutionary and only a small step forward .
yet the real question , madam president , is not a scientific one concerning health or the environment .
he did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in parliament .
on behalf of the ppe group . - mr president , i would like to thank both commissioners .
we can not accept that the intergovernmental conference should do no more than tot up the fors and againsts .
mr clark has the floor for a point of order .
but is this really the case ?
he should visit the so - called region that i represent .
we still have a huge amount of work to do .
we can guarantee skills for everybody .
the third proposal relates to the accession countries .
surely there is nothing more important in developing countries than education .
we have some experience of this in germany .
finally , the south is being hit by a drought .
i hope we can look forward to a future where no instruction will be necessary .
i give the floor to mr falconer .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( nl ) mr president , commissioner , i am grateful to mr sturdy .
it is here that we have to work harder , and for that we need more funding .
that gives us hope for the future .
am i right in thinking that russia already subscribes to the stability pact for south - eastern europe ?
this is by no means an enviable record .
the debate is closed .
these may be only ad hoc approaches , but they have added to the range of culture on offer .
in that sense , it represents a step forward .
how many were sunk and so on ?
1 . membership of committees ( vote )
abiding by the law , with no tolerance for a specific minority , will bring success .
i can therefore tell you that the situation in the country is impossible .
this is perhaps what you were seeking .
trade relations can not be divorced from human rights and development concerns .
as we see it , we have been trying to cure the symptoms since 2008 .
do n't create two mutually independent procurement structures !
this is an important point which should not be forgotten .
these are the circumstances of the dispute , which are inherent in our system .
i give the floor to mr le pen for three minutes .
i hope that the future will find us able to break through the vicious circle of killing and isolating .
we need to keep forging ahead , however .
that is not the act of a friendly state .
when i say ' we ' , i mean the member states .
in some states it is already .
european politics is , as it were , an extension of belgian politics , with a greater purpose .
my final point is that the council looks to adopt this on 7 april .
we therefore have at our disposal standardised information on harmonised measures .
these are all aspects which are covered in the report .
that is what the former prime minister , mr simitis , said .
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
it is the commission 's business to implement that .
this , of course , includes finding food for nine billion people .
what , then , was decided in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism on 5 - 6 december ?
however , we also need to find alternative instruments .
– b5 - 0032/2004 by mrs sandbæk , on behalf of group for a europe of democracies and diversities , on haiti .
the eurostar programme is the most successful example of this and should be developed further .
this is because of the major problem of genetic inheritance .
at the same time , there are some problems we must address , such as liability issues .
this is one of those cases .
( hu ) thank you , mr president , and i would like to congratulate you on your award .
i believe that the draft takes subsidiarity into consideration , albeit insufficiently .
now , we have other real problems .
i also welcome the eur 280 million that you have announced for restructuring .
the bureau also decided that new rules should be introduced for travel expenses .
turning now to mr böge , i want to assure him that i have taken note of his proposals .
the debate is closed .
the debate is closed .
it accords entirely with the ambitions of the swedish presidency .
written declaration ( rule 120 )
this question is not new but now needs to be resolved .
( parliament agreed to the request )
the second was fernanda and the portuguese presidency .
the core of the problem is patently obvious .
this was not an isolated incident .
i do not think much of the idea of developing environmental indicators for packaging .
you can not will the end without willing the means as well .
we must act as europeans .
my reservations regarding the report in question derive from this preliminary consideration .
it needs to be future - proofed ; it needs to be part of an overall process .
of course , many points in the report infringe the principle of subsidiarity of member states .
the great strength of this popular uprising is that it is happening across egypt .
mr cot asked me for a commitment regarding the methods used and the timetable .
therefore , it could not extend to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles .
i would just like to concentrate on one issue .
question no 32 by richard howitt ( h-0647/97 )
the minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
secondly , the report does not mention a salary at all .
it is a disgrace that people should want to undermine the power of the european parliament in the budgetary field .
after all , people also contact us using many other different communication channels .
in fact , the administrative process generally takes between one and two years to allocate the funds .
on the contrary , there is a good deal of research to show that it is in fact effective .
is the timing a coincidence ?
we should not now get bogged down by small print .
the technology is already here , as commissioner verheugen has rightly said .
it has blighted the daily lives of many italians .
it is about intervention .
europe is certainly not closed off to external trade .
this parliament is going to try to work .
that was received well at a conference which the commission arranged in december 1996 .
this is where new jobs should be created in the future : in the small- and medium - sized enterprises .
( parliament approved the minutes )
the commission , however , is trying to impose a system which has yet to be tried out .
being a road is moving forwards .
it is a huge commitment , probably the biggest any of us will experience .
the european voluntary service can be a means to that end .
on financial services , we will hold a debate now .
all of these countries have strong practical reasons to take a further step .
every year , thousands of people drive across the continent on holiday .
if the elections had not been falsified , he would now most likely be the head of state .
but we have some reason for being modestly proud of the achievements that have been made so far .
clearly , today , we are failing on that score .
hence our vote against the report .
you also said that our response must be coherent .
why was nothing said about the opposition to banking secrecy by certain member states ?
( nl ) madam president , the glorious date of 9 july approaches .
however , i do not agree with the automatic mechanism .
this act should be a veritable magna carta for smes .
here again the european parliament has an important role to play .
and what about interoperability in the rail sector ?
the key elements of this paper will never see the light of day .
this sends a positive message to the candidate countries and to the citizens of europe .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
mr   frattini , we have decided to divide the questions into three , by group .
they are the ones with whom we should primarily be concerned .
unwra has suffered a great deal on account of financial problems in recent years .
we in the north have promised our support .
the debate is closed .
5 . 2010 progress report on iceland (
the debate is closed .
this is the subject of amendments nos 1 to 5 , 8 , 12 and 13 .
that is how exhausted the sea is .
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - madam president , the common fisheries policy ( cfp ) has been a miserable failure .
i wish to thank parliament again for this very good resolution .
i find it truly bizarre how quickly this pro - european spirit has been lost .
it highlights good points and problem areas .
nobody has asked for money to be put on the table .
the ostensible purpose of the directive is to ensure that rights can be enforced .
the best means of achieving peace is to form a solid and stable integrating government .
and that is very definitely the position of the german social democrats .
legal and other barriers are to be removed .
in this context i must make a personal confession .
the debate is closed .
diversity is out there in the european cities .
parliament ’s strong support will help to make it a reality .
therefore , the chamber should be fully operational .
i will forward your question to the council .
it is all a very unhappy situation .
what my colleague has just said is true .
all this could end up in an incorrect market mechanism .
president trichet said ' a fiscal union ' .
finland is the only country in the world which is economically fairly dependent on forests .
arms are not toys .
this is what we have attempted to do , both in connection with the maize and in connection with labelling .
let us seize this opportunity with both hands .
the committee on petitions performs the role of listener on behalf of the parliament .
we want a strong commission which drives the european integration process forward .
the european commission is therefore proposing the mobilisation of the sum of eur 453 570 .
this was timed to coincide with coreper 's visit to that city .
the koran , however , makes no mention of jerusalem .
this contributes to the process of bringing citizens closer to european institutions and policies .
my group is , therefore , in favour of an autonomous policy on turkey just short of accession .
we were , however , obliged to support the commission 's proposal in order to avoid any further watering down .
thank you very much for a helpful reply .
we should give the three foreign ministers and the european union a chance .
the second seeks to delete an exception foreseen for belgium .
for the last four years he has been living in spain without a passport - it has expired !
firstly , i want to correct the minutes .
however , it is quite clearly the third set of reforms that is the most important .
this principle is enshrined in our committee 's proposal .
however , it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability .
there is still much to be done , but there is also hope .
with the tsunami , all of us , rich or poor , are in the same boat .
we need to deal with increased globalisation and competition .
what madness that is , when the same causes produce the same effects !
i am obliged to her for making this clear once more .
however , we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved .
this is the european way of life .
that is what i have striven for .
these questions are very important for this debate .
as we have stated , the members of this house are elected to represent national constituencies .
there is plenty of research and empirical evidence supporting this view .
we need these statistics and your support is important here .
france is currently chairing the security council , so it was an important initiative .
i should first like to make some remarks concerning the procedure .
this is all based on a quite clear division of responsibilities .
the european union is already taking on ten new members .
in some of our member states , the procedure of influencing decisions is well organised .
the stronger the institutions , the better they can serve this ideal and our citizens .
the reality is that imf assistance has so far been negligible .
we already know of plans to attack genoa , paris and elsewhere .
that will be self - defeating for us .
this is a package that the liberals and democrats can strongly endorse .
i think that the reasons that mr poettering has just given do not hold water .
it will always be a matter of judgment .
i would like to include military and civil nuclear materials in the same framework .
these are interesting proposals .
three years after the world conference on women at beijing a lot has been achieved .
it is not an unreasonable question to ask .
they are caged in the sense of there being iron bars or nets .
madam president , commissioner verheugen , ladies and gentlemen .
the european union has offered clear signs of its desire to lead this process .
procedurally quite a lot .
allow me firstly to thank commissioner vitorino for his valuable comments .
subject : iraq - un agreement
the second split should be the remainder of that amendment .
is it necessary to reach the 20 % ceiling ?
we do not need a plenary session .
in that case , question time is closed .
we need more than just cleaner engines and sulphur - free fuel .
europe needs more unity .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m.
that said , extending the discharge procedure poses a number of problems .
i would call it common sense .
i appreciate that .
we find this remarkable in the extreme .
we respect , and must respect , the three institutions and the role that they have to play .
great importance is also attached to major projects .
unfortunately , i can not answer all of that in detail due to lack of time .
but where will it take us ?
in short , this is a good , practical example which illustrates the need for reforms in the management sector .
i would also like to congratulate my friend mr jo leinen on the quality of his work .
but at that time the health ministers were not even prepared to get together .
in my view , that is the least it could do .
this is the place to achieve that agreement between the two spheres .
the amendments i have tabled refer to this .
it really is a matter which should be for the airlines .
the achievement of the euro has been a model of interinstitutional cooperation .
i would like nothing better than for the hospital to be working .
they are expected to be finalised within the next few weeks .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
( hu ) minister , i have surprising news for you .
let me give a few examples of what i mean .
every year , smoking leads to the premature death of almost 100 000 europeans .
and this is the task to which we in the european union must contribute .
perhaps he prefers not to , but i should nevertheless like to hear what he has to say .
that , of course , is a signal by which we shall judge her .
the bank has already implemented the lisbon initiatives .
we enhance security and we promote individual rights .
that is one of the comments that i would like to make .
it would be infinitely better to take preventative action .
that is vital .
mr president , while that might be a first step , it is too modest a one .
i very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made .
it goes way beyond the fight against terrorism and i find it unacceptable .
it is possible to raise these things , even if one is committed to fighting discrimination .
so it was quite a group of people who contributed to today 's success .
there is a great deal of irritation that the consultation process has been so long in coming .
in doing so , our position on some high - profile issues has evolved .
that was what members wanted .
but more can still be done .
we are forced to meet in strasbourg .
it also has to do with the stockholm programme .
i have just said what i think of the matter , and you have heard that i share the same feeling .
otherwise we will simply have chaos .
( es ) mr zapatero , please continue with your excellent , modern and progressive policies .
let us put an end to this nonsense !
is this a genuine agreement ?
mrs theato , are you speaking against mr dell'alba ' s motion ?
the second case is that of abu jamal .
