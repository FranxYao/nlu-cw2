as we all know , this is a breach open to all manner of misinterpretation and abuse .
finally , we are working on greatly simplifying the instruments that are currently used .
mr lannoye , i understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned .
what is sustainable development ?
it is extremely important that we reach a conclusion on this .
another important point we raised is that on the middle east conflict .
she has consistently been denied a voice , as have her supporters .
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trends .
the public service must be incorporated into the actual text of the treaty of rome .
the fifth enlargement is the most recent proof of this success .
he is also right in saying that aid workers do extremely dangerous work .
many of the new member states , among them romania , for instance , have no legislation for minorities .
it is most worrying .
my only criticism is that it is a timeless speech .
at least i believe there is no such problem , ladies and gentlemen .
these resolutions are binding for eu member states under international law .
that applies just as much in our own countries .
this system has proved to be very effective .
the rapporteur has just done this .
mr president , this is the text relating to the randzio - plath report .
these are exclusive competences of the member states .
this approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm .
we must be sure of what we want .
our union would benefit greatly from the creation of a common ethical space .
the permitted ceiling in the eu budget is 1.27 % of the combined gnp for the member states .
we want the citizens of europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe .
in my opinion , and i think in truth , it is just a poor political plot .
subject : performance of the automobile industry as regards co2 emissions
there is a probability that malta has fossil - fuel reserves beneath its seabed .
free trade is important , but the freedom of people is just as important .
that is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines .
the government must do more to win over public opinion .
i believe we are failing to give this enough attention .
he has worked very hard on this report and i hope that he will get well soon .
development aid is not only for farmers , it is intended for all sections of society .
no one is better placed than the member state concerned to identify that .
perhaps we will not go beyond midnight .
the legal base is an important issue .
his wife at home must be blind if she can not see that there is quite some activity outside the marital home .
if we seek to make expert reports a precondition , then we shall have to do likewise in the other programmes too .
the council has asked me to reverse the order of the two items scheduled for wednesday morning .
( fr ) mr president , mr bokros , since you have raised the issue , i am going to continue .
i would just like to clarify what mr sacrédeus no doubt already knows .
such things can sometimes be successful or sometimes fail .
i therefore support the recommendations contained in this report .
let us stick to delivering what we agreed to deliver .
if we press the ' no ' button or the ' abstain ' button , the effect will be the same .
many of those around us find the eu very attractive and want to join it .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday .
secondly , we believe that this report represents a step forward .
one kilo per person per year is collected in the district .
mrs zimmermann , i think mr nassauer will have been satisfied by your answer .
the multi - annual guidance programme has failed .
so let us pray , let us hope and let us believe , and as for the rest , amen .
however , we consider that each member state must decide how the issue is dealt with .
that is something we owe to europe and to the people of those countries .
it is therefore only fair to do justice to the concerns of all the parties involved .
however , i am calling on the council not to take the funding from progress .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , he was the right man at the right time .
our procedures are old fashioned , they are as i said ' cumbersome ' .
that of course constitutes interference with the competence of the slovene parliament .
i can therefore only regret that the council has no competence in this matter .
european crisis management will be carried out in line with the principles of the un charter .
rapporteur . - i propose that the word ' women ' be changed to ' individuals ' in paragraph 9 .
let me explain why .
a genuine consumer protection policy must obey various principles .
the electoral fraud and the suppression of protests represent a significant step backwards for belarus .
it will not be confined simply to the transmission of surveillance data .
we in europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy .
prime minister , you spoke with great enthusiasm about enlargement .
this also means improved implementation and correct spending on eu money .
it also ensures coherent and simultaneous actions by all member states .
right now too we are introducing more major areas of policy for the future .
several thousand people have died and hundreds have been arrested .
it is most apt that we should have a resolution on zimbabwe .
we should therefore be very careful here .
i can not understand why the document clutches at the straw of exports .
we saw the eurostat scandal .
there it has succeeded .
the latter represents a key piece of information for the consumer before a product is purchased .
there is an inevitable , indeed necessary , area of overlap with existing instruments .
for me the answer is clear .
we are also making progress in other areas because we have to look at the real economy .
i would like to thank everyone for that .
curious things went round the world about sheep meat , about lamb .
( the president cut off the speaker )
i urge you to support this resolution .
we should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on an urgently needed report .
but these authorities are neither independent , as it is claimed , nor free to act .
moreover , we are prepared to start immediately .
we are not here just to say what the fishermen wish to hear .
it was not then in a position to do so .
mr barroso will , of course , stand as a candidate without opposition , without an alternative .
the agency has , however , been denied another core competence .
together , we are determined to prevent another ferry disaster .
1.the molitor group states that a distinction should be made between simplification and deregulation .
the first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility .
this underlines the seriousness of the problems .
are there any objections to this oral amendment being included ?
however , no one wants to pay to attain these objectives .
they must instead be the main beneficiaries of it .
i have actually read the proposals in council directive 92/102 and i welcome them .
what has made europe strong is its openness .
the solutions are only effective inasmuch as they are interdependent .
this is a point on which mr kozlík has given a very good explanation .
unfortunately , once again we are forced to address them .
we need more courage to overcome the crisis using european resources .
why is it that this house is in this difficult position ?
i welcome this initiative .
i know that the budget is an issue that parliament feels very strongly about .
in that sense , it is a bad name .
many of us believe that the situation is already becoming extremely worrying .
that is the situation we are dealing with .
in general , this also applies to the industrialised nations .
there is nothing more noble than solidarity .
many have spoken about the economic crisis .
it was a gentlemen 's agreement , and it should not become the rule .
it should be based on a well - balanced impact assessment .
i think it appropriate to particularly draw attention to this at this time of year .
we never travelled in the same car twice , because we knew we were being monitored .
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
i hope it will happen more fully very soon .
this would then safeguard the substance of natura 2000 .
a european venture capital market is just one of many measures that can be taken .
yesterday there was an unsuccessful attempt to murder the transitional president , abdullahi yusuf .
russian prisons are overcrowded .
relations of mine are still active in humanitarian agencies in that country .
this needs to be done now .
we are the principal bloc at the wto and have a specific responsibility .
i acknowledge , however , that this is a question that we must ask ourselves when the time arises .
we have put in place legislation which will work in the future .
we are particularly concerned about working time and how it affects the transport sector .
rural development is threatening to become one of them .
it is important to make progress little by little , if that is the only way that progress can be made .
apparently this was not possible for procedural reasons .
it is our biggest headache in several respects , as you well know , commissioner .
and it does not .
for that to be the case , however , a great deal will have to change .
so finally the european union is starting to move .
but the brussels waiting rooms are large , and waiting times uncertain .
i experienced this in belgium for nine years , mr lange .
i very quickly persuaded him otherwise .
i met a group called ' september 11 families for peaceful tomorrows ' .
i do not therefore believe that we can accept amendment no 8 .
the old tacis regulation lapsed six months ago and there is still no new one .
that concludes the voting .
we really need to keep on the edge of our seats .
it will allow us to assess the best calculation methods in this field .
union enlargement will mean the reform of the institutional system .
these have been mentioned , and there is no need to specify them all .
without europeans , europe means nothing .
we have seen the berlin wall tumble down , we have seen the iron curtain swept aside .
as soon as they do so the commission will be able to proceed .
for these reasons , i voted in favour of the report .
and i would also like to say : not just for three hours a day !
they are thinking about it , but it has not yet happened .
i have to say i disagree with commissioner patten in relation to the trade agreements .
we might well , therefore , ask ourselves sometimes whether the commissioners ever talk to one another .
( protests from mr posselt )
we have already discussed this with you at length .
i will only mention three specific major points and three minor points .
that is a prerequisite .
we offer you our co - operation .
in wartime citizens of all ethnic backgrounds flee .
we will need to take action in iran .
the government has allowed this to happen .
the second question relates to the method .
i believe , however , that our paths diverge considerably .
a european patent system is a necessity .
the next item is question time to the council ( b4 - 0164/97 ) .
i would add that the objective for 2020 is 80 grams per kilometre .
apart from that , mr president , i should like to say a word about the commission .
as far as this issue is concerned , we are aware and it is in hand .
in short , it can become a symbol of europe 's ability to work together and innovate .
in my view and that of the liberal group , this is going too far .
i represent southern italy , which is located in the south of europe in the mediterranean basin .
we have this triptych here neatly from ms evans : replacement , reduction and scaling down .
why have you not consulted the national parliaments on the mandate ?
i can repeat the electronic check .
the present government has two years to adopt this law .
that is what i wish to call for now .
i can answer all three together , or do i have to answer each question individually ?
it is the most important aspect to come .
the commission says it wants to retain its board seat .
firstly , the question of competition between ports .
because , today , 60 % of europeans live in the urban community .
however , those conclusions can not prejudge the judgment itself .
you can also look that up easily in the legislation .
what are we really talking about here ?
i would like the commissioner herself to state what exactly she did or did not say .
however they are a welcome contribution to the overall plan of action .
we are backing the commission 's proposals .
what we value most of all is the internal liberal debate .
mr president , i welcome this report from my colleague mr cornillet .
what sort of single market will we create ?
we must inform and convince the council of this .
moratorium on the death penalty
that is the only way to resolve this procedural issue .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i wish to thank you very sincerely for your contributions .
economic and democratic development in three of the four countries has been weak .
( the president cut the speaker off )
the committee on budgets , however , rejected our proposals .
i feel strongly committed to this process , even though it could still be improved .
it is forecast to increase to usd 7 596 in 2008 .
the cost of the validation process also warrants discussion .
the treaty now has the democratic endorsement of all 27 member states .
they have organized themselves internationally , while you are hesitating to do so .
public trust in politics has been seriously damaged .
let us support the tobacco growers ' efforts !
the debate is closed .
given the lack of time i shall limit myself to two remarks .
it is very embarrassing .
we are only meant to have two minutes .
in the end , analytical results showed that the products were compliant with eu legislation .
i accept the criticisms , i can even admit that i can be wrong .
this is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now .
the truth is that some member states have not done so .
every morning it logs on to the official journal .
that is indeed something completely different from providing information on board the .
the president may exclude a member .
i call on the commissioner to think it over for once .
i know that is impolite , but i would ask you to understand and bear with me .
i would like to comment on the more specific market sectors .
you will remember this .
russia is still a country where freedom of expression is a myth .
the future of european democracy rests very heavily on irish shoulders .
it should certainly be the main criterion , but not the only one .
here , it is again a question of , if i may put it this way , cast - off national politicians .
we also warn against intolerance based on atheism .
so there is a huge problem there as well .
this point has not yet been resolved .
we will secure attractive , effective and safe rail transport .
why , then , you may ask , should enlargement give rise to those fears ?
this report is highly critical .
( parliament approved the minutes )
did you actually not know anything about the financial imbalance in greece ?
the power of media ownership now frequently extends across national borders .
nevertheless , we are falling seriously behind .
perhaps the commissioner could make a statement to the council .
the joint debate is closed .
they would also like to be able to participate in council meetings when their competences are at stake .
europe 2020 ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see minutes
then there is the socio - economic tragedy .
these are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being .
what has become of horizontal anti - discrimination legislation ?
but i will pass on your question .
internally , europe must be modern , but above all it must be competitive in external markets .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
in writing . - in favour .
this is an essential plank of the financial services action plan .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
this is the basic process that we can either speed up or slow down .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , in fact the problem can not be taken seriously enough .
the european parliament furthermore proposes exactly the same thing in its draft resolution .
i should at this point also like to make something else quite clear : i am not against them either .
( de ) in the first half of this year , gas suppliers ' fuel oil prices fell by up to 40 % .
at this point , we would like to give two pieces of advice or express two hopes .
everyone must act against the nationalist and extremist tendencies emerging in their own country .
of course the commission should also issue recommendations , for example in relation to reducing debt .
in the light of current practice , which is stagnant , this is a useful move forward .
what we want is quite simple : throw the lobbyists out of the commission offices !
russia must fully honour the peace accord .
the adoption of these general guidelines is an example of this .
the myth of an information - based society has become a reality .
let us therefore be realistic about the options that data retention opens to us .
plenty of words and no action .
the number of consultations of the register is continuing to increase .
it is really a united europe in which we have different standards of living .
we believe that the transposition period of three years is unnecessary .
only now do we find ourselves in a situation where genuinely concerted efforts are possible .
fortunately , things are starting to change .
it has certainly not been an easy journey .
moreover , the alternatives to nickel cadmium batteries appear to be far superior .
i am all in favour of the equal treatment of men and women in the eyes of the law .
on lithuania we are saying that considerable progress has also been made .
these are the positive signs .
if europe receives the measure with which it has already given , it ought therefore to get a lot in cancun .
this is , in fact , a response to what the european parliament is doing .
but that is not the end of the matter .
perhaps you could explain to us why .
the next item is the vote on the crisis in the steel sector
that is sufficient reason to support this policy fully .
as you know , mr   maccormick has already raised this question in a different way .
i would like to make another comment regarding this possible extension .
this screening operation is supposed to be completed this month .
we should not be spinning and pretending otherwise .
the spring european council was a moment of truth .
only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved .
this therefore is the sine qua non to transparency and it is the sine qua non to proper democratic explanation .
yet the constitution , however you look at it , is to a large extent discredited .
i believe another one is about to start .
the debate is closed .
this does not mean the lowest common denominator of existing national regimes .
we are pledged to making a fresh start for europe .
the last one should be sent , we hope , very soon .
i thank mr lindqvist .
what clear legal basis is there inside this european union ?
firstly , the stability and growth pact .
prevention is better than compensation .
that is the imperative !
montenegrin politicians must do everything in their power to alter that image .
we want and need to relaunch the lisbon strategy .
in my view , it ought to be the other way around .
i did press very hard indeed but unfortunately it was not achievable .
the debate is closed .
( de ) madam president , the florenz report actually contains a lot of good suggestions .
is there or is there not a need for more initiatives ?
is there no way to keep the two issues separate ?
there is a very great lack of this .
i would like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate for their views .
in this respect , there is a need for reform of the structural funds .
another thing of great importance is that commercial advertising is still outlawed .
so we have a moral obligation to accept the baltic states as soon as possible .
i wish to deal briefly with the main headings of the resolution .
do you never learn ?
in fact , the approach we have put forward in the revision of the neighbourhood policy is clear .
many thanks for your request to speak .
if we do not wish to have to act this way in the future , we must try to prevent such situations .
if it is thought through properly , you will get a majority for transparency and competition in europe .
i retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise .
the eu member states have not adopted any such charter .
we are doing so with the feio report and we are doing so with our daily legislative work .
europe is open to migration .
now i ask you : what does the commission intend to do ?
there is no way in which he is capable of going in the direction of what the commission is proposing .
in all more than 50 million people will have no opportunity to participate in this debate .
as commissioner   grybauskaitė has already announced , some are to be incorporated .
the content of the current resolution overlooks the causes of hooliganism , whether or not consciously .
president obama or the senate , which has so far refused to find a solution ?
it covers iraq and the rest of the middle east .
we will continue to push for an ambitious result .
you say we can not make external border controls public .
in order to guarantee human freedoms , sacrifices must be borne .
i shall then offer my explanation of vote .
there are great opportunities as well as serious risks .
civil society represents a hope of achieving a civilised society .
i now come to the problem of assisting the population .
that would be the first step on what may be a possible path to a solution .
i believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only this helps us effectively stand against any future crisis .
thank you for that answer , commissioner .
i am very concerned .
that decision was taken by the belgian government .
so the plea is for assistance from europe .
. a majority in this house unfortunately will not learn .
i wholeheartedly supported the commission 's proposal on european citizenship .
( de ) madam president , improving the rights of passengers on regular bus and coach services is a desirable goal .
the report also takes account of scientific research in this area of veterinary science .
there have been very serious violations of human rights in china and this should be taken into account .
it is true , however , that the council has denied us , by various blockages , the legal basis since last november , when the barcelona conference took place .
thank you for your request , mr corbett , which is also relevant .
mr titley once referred to us as those tyrants in the committee on budgets .
the june list does not , however , wish to contribute to any fortress europe .
this follows on consistently from the steps we have already taken in recent years .
we do not have much time left to us , and action is urgently needed .
we have got to implement them .
the release of the soldier , gilad shalit , has been discussed in this house .
i voted for rejection of the commission proposal on ‘ humane’ trapping standards .
that has been the constant practice of all my predecessors and is consistent with the rules .
at some point we are going to have to decide which of these two things is to have priority .
when discussing this legislation we talked a lot about impact assessments .
montenegro participates actively in regional cooperation .
if officialdom can ignore the rules , why should we not ignore them too ?
that was how it was .
growth must be not only economically sustainable but also environmentally sustainable .
i also believe the commission made the mistake of accepting these missions .
the same applies to mrs giannakou ' s report .
amendment no 1 concerns the legal basis of the proposal .
i can only hope that lessons were learned from these mistakes .
this report contains the solution .
a euro coin made of gold can therefore continue this laudable tradition .
for these reasons , we were not able to vote for this report .
we hope that entry will lead to a more balanced protection of interest .
fight against terrorism ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see minutes
politicians should not therefore , under any circumstances , plan nuclear plants in active earthquake zones .
what we need are three new regulations in parallel .
indeed , it is the only thing that ever has ' .
i do not know which rule of the rules of procedure this is based on .
so that is the text which applies if it is adopted .
but let us see whether we can make any progress with it .
it reinforces this initiative , which will thus make travelling easier for our fellow citizens .
we want better regulation , and we members of parliament should be setting a good example .
thirdly , we should realise how difficult the task is that europe is now undertaking .
the committee on fisheries insists on this being done .
what should happen next ?
i can not imagine this to be the case .
i ask myself what the problem is .
thank you , commissioner fischler .
let me make a comment on the fact that two members of the potential commission have been criticised .
i doubt that very much .
working women are often perceived to be ' high risk ' or ' second rate ' workers .
the convention on the future of europe currently sitting would like to strengthen this role .
mr president , i sincerely hope you will not cut me off .
that is the conclusion .
iraq has tried to use the weakened position of the us president for its own benefit .
the question is : why can we not manage that in the eu ?
the next step will really be how the council will deal with the rewording of article 47 .
reducing the amount of organic compounds is necessary for two reasons .
mr president , i should like to start by making an unusual statement .
of course , we want community procedures for asylum .
accordingly , it must , as a matter of urgent priority , be translated fully into practical reality .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
we need an assurance from both the commission and the council that this will not happen .
at least that is the goal we have set ourselves .
in other words , the system works like a vacuum cleaner and the intelligence services operate the filter .
the example of italy is fresh in our minds .
the first aspect , which relates to amendments nos 9 , 14 and the second part of 17 , concerns veteran vehicles .
never again . this is what politicians decided in post - war europe .
our role is modest , admittedly , but it is demanding too .
once again , it does not pay to be honest .
the fifth involves the freedom of entry and residence , even for third - country nationals .
it is an issue on which the efficiency and essence of european policy is being judged .
the eu must also support solutions which may seem unconventional at the moment .
the polluter pays principle must apply to all .
this traceability is essential for food safety .
we must also rapidly attain the objective of a fair and efficient asylum system in europe .
it is true that we grant macrofinancial aid to certain third countries with difficulties .
the voters were intimidated .
i do not think any further comment is needed on my part .
global warming has stopped .
you responded to some of our concerns in your statement .
they are making demands of us .
we must be prepared for a long haul .
we have already done that .
that is why the commission believes that all donors should work closely with untaet .
but the easing or cancellation of debt is not sufficient in itself .
we have to remedy that .
that is not what i want .
one feels really powerless .
let us just concentrate on specific measures .
thus , i am at a loss to understand what mr watson , the chairman of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , has just said .
it is for life .
i think it may be said that we shall get to know each other .
the pamuk case indicates how important freedom of expression is .
well done , mrs merkel , warm congratulations !
in the one month between november and december , pricing in that market rose by over 50 % .
this concerns above all the ignalina nuclear power plant and what is to happen to it .
a communication will be adopted by the end of the year .
the commission has been found guilty of malpractice .
the situation is also evidence of the european union 's deficient energy policy .
as far as the rest is concerned , i wish you and us all luck .
sadly this is not the case , to a greater extent in some of the countries of europe , to a lesser in others .
we entirely share this view .
the discretion of the state must not take precedence over that of the people .
( parliament adopted the text )
the point is that there is still a voting session tonight and tomorrow morning .
there is much talk of privatisation and liberalisation .
of course , therefore , i could not fail to vote for the ainardi report .
access to the funds should be simpler and also more user - friendly .
is this something that can be considered , and where are we heading ?
we can but hope .
i totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by mr morillon .
i would also like to thank mrs patrão neves , who has done an excellent job of conducting the negotiations .
meanwhile , in some mosques , as everywhere else in europe , jihad is being proclaimed .
this is all the more alarming because the violence is accompanied by particular cruelty .
i would like to focus once more on two particular points .
the difference is about ecu 4 billion , soon to be four billion euros .
i am not being pessimistic here , just realistic .
the situation in pakistan is very disquieting .
this is something quite intolerable .
to arrive in afghanistan or kabul is to enter a world that is exclusively male .
the question of minorities remains .
we support the additional measures advocated in the original report .
you referred to the danger of institutional crisis .
so i will confine myself to asking the president of the council a few questions .
thank you , commissioner .
some of the recommendations made by the experts were thus able to be taken into consideration .
europe now faces a serious test .
this is a pretty repulsive habit .
we are all agreed that an effective transplantation system needs to be developed .
secondly , this plan includes those countries that do not have any prospect of membership .
the proper distinction between austerity and the european perspective has been blurred .
a number of member states actually authorise such sanctions .
i can agree with it almost without reservation .
the same was the case for the earlier enlargements of the european community .
three solutions are then possible .
we have no grounds for believing that the metal is particularly toxic .
we have not really sanctioned any individual responsibilities .
mr president , i just wish to address the issue of human rights .
i believe that you really should follow the lead provided here by myself and mrs hall .
and this is especially important in relation to two issues .
of course , everything possible should be done to prevent fraud .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
in any case , whatever its final form , the national parliaments should not have been sidelined .
meanwhile , you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice .
( el ) mr president , i should like to speak about accidents at work in greece and europe .
we have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place .
my final point concerns the issue of delegated acts .
would it be in violation of our obligations under gatt ?
that must be said .
it is they who are the source of the changes .
i shall refer this matter to the conference of presidents .
we can take the new it sector as an example .
since then , the people responsible for public health no longer take any risks whatsoever .
freedom on the internet is the best guarantee of freedom of expression .
we do not see anything and we do not say anything at all on the matter .
the next item is the debate on :
japan is facing its greatest post - war disaster .
from next year onwards , all recipients of agricultural support will be disclosed on the internet .
